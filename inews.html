         Rules in (and for) the Web have become a mainstream topic since
         <i>inference rules</i> were <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/rules/home.html">marked up for E-Commerce</a> and were identified as a
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html">Design Issue</a> of the
         <a href="http://www.semanticweb.org/">Semantic Web</a>, and since <i>transformation rules</i> were put to practice for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javaxml/chapter/ch09.html">document generation from a central XML repository</a> (<a href="#Practice-Preach">as used here</a>).
         Moreover, rules have continued to play an important role in
         <a href="http://www.mailgate.org/comp/comp.ai.shells/">AI shells</a> for knowledge-based systems and
         in <a href="http://agents.umbc.edu/">Intelligent Agents</a>, today both needing a Web interchange format,
         and such XML/RDF-standardized rules are now also usable for the declarative specification of
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/">Web Services</a>.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         The Rule Markup Initiative has taken steps towards defining
         a shared Rule Markup Language (RuleML),
         permitting both forward (bottom-up) and backward (top-down) rules in XML
         for deduction, rewriting, and further inferential-transformational tasks.
         The initiative started during
         <a href="http://www3.cm.deakin.edu.au/pricai/">PRICAI 2000</a>,
         as described in the <a href="RuleML/sld001.htm">Original RuleML Slide</a>,
         and was
         <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.prolog/browse_thread/thread/41090fff5c9f08ca/1e45a73b28d5483f">launched</a>
         in the Internet on 2000-11-10.
         Besides the previous <a href="indtd.html">XML-only RuleML</a> and
         the current <a href="inspec">XML/RDF-combining RuleML</a>,
         there is also an approach towards an <a href="#RDF">RDF-only RuleML</a>.
         <a href="#Engines">Complementary efforts</a>
         consist of the development of (Java-based) rule engines such as <a href="http://www.jdrew.org/">jDREW</a> and
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mandarax">Mandarax</a> RuleML,
         as well as XSB-RDF RuleML.
         RuleML's earlier <a href="#Design">design</a>
         evolved into <a href="#DTDs-Schemas">DTDs-Schemas</a>
         for positional-slotted RuleML sublanguages including <a href="indoo">Object-Oriented RuleML (OO RuleML)</a>.
         Efforts also went into defining <a href="http://www.omg.org/docs/br/03-10-02.pdf">MOF-RuleML: The Abstract Syntax of RuleML as a MOF Model</a>.

                         there has been enormous growth in unstructured and semi-structured textual material
                         distributed on the web, for instance legal sources. Yet a substantial knowledge-acquisition
                         bottleneck remains in using Human Language Technologies (HLT) to translate from this
                         material to machine-readable, knowledge-based semantic representations. The 'Human-Rules'
                         Special Track of RuleML 2013 has its focus on these issues, providing a forum for current
                         work and a venue for the exchange of ideas. For details, important dates, and submission

                  <li> 2011-03-17: <a href="http://www.athant.com">Athan Services</a> and RuleML have started
                         a project on re-engineering and improving the RuleML XSDs in <a href="http://relaxng.org/">Relax NG</a>. The first result of this project is a version of RuleML 0.91 in Relax NG,
                         which implements bindatalog in the normal form. The modular design of the Relax NG schema
                         will allow greater flexibility in customizing language features, increased ease of
                         development, testing, and documentation. The design also prepares the way for the second
                         phase of the project, the alignment of a subset of RuleML with <a href="http://common-logic.org/">Common Logic</a>. Items currently available for
                         alpha-testing from the RuleML website include the <a href="http://ruleml.org/0.91/relaxng">Relax NG schema</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/">Trang</a>-generated

                         interoperable in order to automate collaboration across communities using a declarative,

                     co-located with the 11th International Business Rules Forum (<a href="http://www.businessrulesforum.com">BR Forum</a>).
                     RuleML-2008, is the primary venue to discuss and exchange new ideas, practical developments and experiences
                     on issues pertinent to the interchange and applications of rules in open distributed environments such as the Web.
                     RuleML-2008 will enable delegates to better understand Web Rules and Rule-Based Event Processing technologies and their potential,
                     and how to exploit these technologies in their organizations. 
                     A RuleML-2008 Challenge with prizes will be organized to demonstrate tools, use cases, case studies and applications.
