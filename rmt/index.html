<p><a NAME="technical-description"></a><b><font color="#AF0000">Motivation
and Goals of the Seminar</font></b>
<p><i>Rules</i> have classically been used in formal languages, compiler
technology, databases, logic programming, knowledge representation, and
OO modeling, with applications ranging from car diagnosis, to email filtering,
to enterprise integration.
<i>Rule markup</i> in the Web has become a hot
topic since rules were identified as a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html">Design
Issue</a> of the Semantic Web. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic
Web</a> is a new W3C Activity trying<i> </i>to represent information in
the World Wide Web such that it can be used by machines not just for display
purposes, but for automation, integration, and reuse across applications.
<p><i>Rule markup techniques</i> for the Semantic Web, however, have been
less systematically studied than the corresponding vocabulary (taxonomy)
markup. This
<font color="#000000">Dagstuhl Seminar&nbsp;</font> tries
to fill the gap by exploring rule systems (e.g., extended Horn logics)
suitable for the Web, their (XML and RDF) syntax, semantics, tractability/efficiency,
and transformation/compilation. Both derivation rules (which may be evaluated
bottom-up as in deductive databases, top-down as in logic programming,
or by tabled resolution as in XSB)&nbsp; and reaction rules (also called
"active" or "event-condition-action" rules), as well as any combinations,
will be considered.
<p><i>Ontologies</i> for the Semantic Web can use rules to define <i>axioms</i>
operating on a <i>taxonomy</i>, but also to compute the taxonomy from given
concept definitions. Further purposes of rule markup include:
<ul>
<li>
Providing a <i>rule interchange format</i> for exchanging rules between
different tools/systems</li>

<li>
Marking up rule content in business documents (for example, discount rules
can be included in an internal XML-based product catalog distributed to
dealers)</li>

<li>
Providing a high-level specification language for active content (such&nbsp;
as agents) in the Web</li>

<li>
Expressing an interaction protocol (i.e., the public part of an inter-organizational
business process) as a set of reaction rules and marking it up for communication
over the Web)</li>
</ul>
To accomodate the various user communities from knowledge-based systems,
to intelligent agents, to e-commerce, possibilities for a modular <i>rule-language
hierarchy</i> will be discussed. It should permit the mixing and matching
of rules of appropriate expressive <i>power </i>as well as computational
<i>efficiency</i>
for classes of applications. This may be facilitated by a separation of
concerns:
<p><b>Semantics:</b> A classical hierarchy<i> </i>version can be bottomed
on ground facts over individual constants; a Webized version could also
permit URIs as arguments and names of (binary) relations, much like in
RDF triples. On this basis, the classical Datalog, Horn-rule, and equational-logic
layers could similarly be extended by URIs as relation, constructor, and
function symbols. More advanced rule extensions could include suitable
negations for the open world of the Web, feature or F-Logic terms for RDF's
anonymous resources, labelings for prioritized business rules, and local
rule packages for N3's contexts. The power-efficiency tradeoff should inform
us whether the hierarchies, classical and Webized, can be topped by rules
in full first-order or even restricted higher-order logic.
<p><b>Syntax:</b> Classical and Webized rules from the hierarchy can be
marked up in pure XML, RDF, or a combination of both, as reflected by the
evolution of RuleML. It should be <font color="#000000">examined where
current definition methods
</font>(e.g., DTDs vs. XML Schemas)
<font color="#000000">are
sufficient for such
</font>rule markup and <font color="#000000">where
they</font> would need revisions/extensions. Also non-XML rule(-presentation)
formats may be considered for (editors of) a future Web such as colored-ASCII
versions of ISO Prolog, Relfun, KIF, Jess, F-Logic, and N3 or graphical
notations inspired by XML's trees and RDF's directed labeled graphs.
<p>This <font color="#000000">Dagstuhl Seminar</font> is thus expected
to <font color="#000000">contribute to</font> some open issues of recent
proposals such as Notation 3 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html">N3</a>),
<a href="http://daml.umbc.edu/proposaltasks.shtml#tasktwo">DAML-Rules</a>,
and the Rule Markup Language (<a href="http://www.dfki.de/ruleml">RuleML</a>).
Furthermore, by studying issues of combining rules and taxonomies via sorted
logics, description logics, or frame systems, t<font color="#000000">he
Seminar will also discuss the US-European proposal </font><a href="http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-walkthru.html">DAML+OIL</a>.
Two particular issues that will be addressed during this seminar are efficient
implementation
<font color="#000000">techniques (e.g., via </font>Java-based
rule engines) and major exchange applications (<font color="#000000">e.g.,
using e-business rules)</font>.
<p>In sum, "Rule Markup Techniques" aims at bringing together the classical-
and Web-rule communities to cross-fertilize between their foundations,
methods, and applications. The long-term goal is a Web-based standard for
rules that makes use of, and is also useful to, the classical rule perspective.<font color="#000000">

Seminar participants are encouraged to suggest further steps in this international
effort at any time.</font>

in
<br>the Knowledge Modeling Group at Stanford University in 1999.&nbsp;
Before
<br>that, he led, and published on, several government and industrial
<br>projects in knowledge representation, compilation, and evolution. He
<br>received PhD and Habilitation degrees in computer science from the
<br>Universities of Hamburg and Kaiserslautern, respectively.&nbsp; He

<br>together with Dr. Said Tabet, launched the Rule Markup Initiative
<br>(RuleML).
<p><b><font size=+1>Benjamin Grosof</font></b>
<p>Dr. Benjamin Grosof is Assistant Professor in Information Technology
at
<br>the MIT Sloan School of Management.&nbsp; His research addresses e-commerce
<br>and Web technology, combining agent communication, XML, and knowledge
<br>representation for applications in contracting, negotiation, and
<br>business policies.&nbsp; He co-leads the RuleML initiative, an emerging
<br>industry standard for XML Rules.&nbsp; He is Principal Investigator
<br>currently for a project in the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML)
<br>initiative, designing knowledge-level techniques to realize the vision
<br>of the Semantic Web.&nbsp; Previously, he was a senior research scientist
<br>at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.&nbsp; While at IBM, most recently
he
<br>founded and led a project on Business Rules for E-Commerce.&nbsp; This
<br>produced IBM CommonRules (V2.1 currently on IBM alphaWorks), which
<br>pioneered XML inter-operable business rules with conflict handling
and
<br>XML agent communication.&nbsp; He co-led its application piloting for
<br>rule-based XML agent contracting in EECOMS, a $29Million NIST industry
<br>consortium project on manufacturing supply chain management.&nbsp;
He holds
<br>a PhD from Stanford University in Computer Science, with specialty
<br>Artificial Intelligence, and a BA from Harvard University in Applied
<br>Mathematics, with specialty economics and management science.&nbsp;
He is
<br>author of over 30 refereed publications, two major software releases,
<br>and one patent; and has served on numerous program committees,
<br>including co-chairing the AAAI Conference Workshops on AI in
<br>E-Commerce (1999) and Knowledge-Based E-Markets (2000).&nbsp; He will
<br>be co-teaching a tutorial on Agent Communication in Knowledge Based
<br>Electronic Markets at the IJCAI-2001 Conference.
