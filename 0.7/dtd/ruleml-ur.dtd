<!-- ENTITY Declarations -->


<!-- a Uniform Resource Identifier is currently PCDATA, but see W3C's [RFC2396] -->

<!-- ELEMENT and ATTLIST Declarations -->


<!-- there is an additional kind of fixed argument -->

<!-- objects (resources) use a URL/URI as their OID, as in SHOE or RDF (cf. URML) -->
<!-- however, unlike for XHTML anchors etc. URI used as content, not as attribute -->
<!-- 'label' attribute, unlike URI, need not be unique -->
<!-- if no 'label' attribute is given, browser must highlight the URI itself -->
<!ELEMENT ur (%URI;)>
<!ATTLIST ur label CDATA #IMPLIED>
