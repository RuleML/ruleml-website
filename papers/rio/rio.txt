This Rule Interoperation Ontology (RIO) is the beginning of a Knowledge Interoperation Ontology
specialized to rule base interoperation and combinable with an ontology of rule types.
RIO currently has the form of a taxonomy with multiple inheritance expressed through
cross-references (see, recursively ...). The resulting Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) can be
implemented using OO jDREW's type definitions based on RDF Schema's subClassOf property.
