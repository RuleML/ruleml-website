      <h3>Datalog Characteristics - Notes</h3>
      <p>In the above Datalog markup, the three top-level <span
        style="font-family: courier; font-style: italic"></span><span
          style="font-style: italic">"spent at least"</span> arguments are not further
        analyzed; they are considered as just individual constants. For
        identification purposes, they, and the relation itself, would need to be repeated verbatim by a query
        that is to retrieve the above fact (as illustrated by the query in the if part
        of the rule below). A step-wise refining analysis could exhibit the internal
        structure and natural-language meaning of the relation and basic three arguments using
        further, auxiliary, arguments, or proceeding from Datalog to Hornlog  (function-ful) RuleML, 
        with all steps marked up in RuleML.</p>
      
      <p>Notice that in Datalog RuleML a relation can be n-ary (polyadic), i.e.
        have a variable, but finite, number, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., of arguments. 
        A Datalog restricted to unary (monadic) and binary (dyadic)
        relations  is an important special case, e.g. for combining
        RuleML with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">OWL</a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/"></a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/"></a>, as in <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/SUBM-SWRL-20040521/">SWRL</a>. While
        the above markup uses one 3-ary<span
          style="font-family: courier; font-style: italic"></span><span
            style="font-style: italic">"spent at least"</span> relation, it could also be
        reduced to three binary relations branching off from an individual constant
        that stands for the ternary relationship, as suggested by the above RDF-oriented XML visualization and explained in a <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/">W3C Working Group Note</a>.
        However, to preserve the expressiveness of the relational model for databases and SQL as well as of Prolog, Datalog RuleML permits the straight representation of n-ary relations, as visualized with directed hyperarcs in <a href="http://ruleml.org/#Grailog">Grailog</a>.
        Moreover, Datalog RuleML provides for the markup of SQL-style null values via empty
        individuals, &lt;Ind/&gt;.</p>
