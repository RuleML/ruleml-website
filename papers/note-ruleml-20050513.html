        <ol>
          <li>Be in spirit of the Web, accomodate its openness, exploit its
            other aspects: esp. URI's, namespaces, XML as syntactic
          vehicle</li>
          <li>Design approach of Webizing: name relations and functions,
            rules, rule subsets/modules -- by using URI's and namespaces</li>
          <li>Bridge XML and RDF data models, be able to exploit RDF and
            harmonize with it (this might help speed RDF in rules world)</li>
          <li>Tasks: inferencing, (XSLT) translation, static analysis</li>
          <li>Applications: business policies, business process automation
            and workflow, e-contracting, security/authorization/trust</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Aim to support RDF, and also to support XML directly for those not
        (directly) dealing with RDF</li>
      <li>Design approach: abstract (graph-theoretical) data model with
        labeled arcs and minimal ordered arcs; inspired by software/data
        engineering practice, and by RDF, alternative syntactic encodings in
        XML and RDF; in-progress also in OWL -- to be coordinated with Joint
        Committee</li>
      <li>Pursue: multiple KR expressiveness classes, which form a partial
        order</li>
      <li>Design approach: hierarchy of expressive classes, syntax
        specification (incl. DTDs and later XML Schema) for each 
        <ol>
          <li>Some defined already, others in progress, even more ones
            provided from RuleML community</li>
          <li>Need syntactic mechanics for this: e.g., in DTDs and XML
          Schema</li>
          <li>In progress: it's useful to think in terms of a few different
            rules types: not just derivation and transformation, but also:
            action/reaction; however, these not yet well worked out wrt
            consensus way to view them, nor in some ways wrt the fundamental
            research understanding</li>

<h2><a id="section_1" name="section_1">1. Background</a></h2>

<h3><a id="section_1_1" name="section_1_1">1.1 The need for Rules on the
Web</a></h3>

<p>Rules have traditionally been used in theoretical computer science,
compiler technology, databases, logic programming, and Artificial
Intelligence. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">The Semantic Web</a>tries
to represent information in the World Wide Web such that it can be used by
machines not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration,
sharing and reuse across applications. Rule Markup for the Semantic Web has
been a hot topic since rules were identified as one of its <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html">design issues</a>.</p>

<p>However, Semantic Web rules have been less systematically studied than the
corresponding ontology (actually, taxonomy) markup. The Rule Markup
Initiative tries to fill the gap by exploring rule systems (e.g., extended
Horn logics) suitable for the Web, their (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>) syntax, semantics,
tractability/efficiency, and transformation and compilation. Both derivation
rules (which may be evaluated bottom-up as in deductive databases, top-down
as in logic programming, or by tabled resolution as in <a
href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/">XSB</a>) and reaction rules (also called
"ECA" - "Event-Condition-Action" -- or "trigger" rules), as well as possible
combinations, are being considered.</p>

<p>In the context of the Semantic Web, rules may be built on F-logic for <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> inference, as pioneered by <a
href="http://ontobroker.semanticweb.org/silri/">SiLRI</a>. This work has
recently been extended for rules with expressive bodies (full FOL syntax) in
<a href="http://triple.semanticweb.org/">TRIPLE</a>. Rules may also be used
to enhance the content of Web pages and XML documents in various ways. E.g.,
derivation rules allow the dynamic inclusion of derived facts, while reaction
rules allow the specification of behavior in response to browser events.</p>

<h3><a id="section_1_2" name="section_1_2">1.2 Earlier work on XML markup for
Web rules</a></h3>

<p>RuleML started on the basis of pre-existing rule markup languages and has
already inspired further rule-markup projects. As examples, we just sketch
our RFML, URML, and BRML languages here, but refer readers to <a
href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ruleml/#Participants">The RuleML Participants
List</a> for the complete picture. Our effort also includes integration with
the RDFZ Query and Ontology Web Language (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL</a>).</p>

<p><strong>RFML</strong> (Relational-Functional Markup Language) is a
(Web-)output format for relational-functional knowledge bases and
computations implemented as part of the Relfun system. The (Web-)input
translation of RFML markup into Relfun's Prologlike syntax is implemented via
an XSLT stylesheet.</p>

<p><strong>URML</strong> was initially a project to Webize the ART and
ARTScript Rule Language. URML is pushing the effort further to integrate
Object Oriented Rule-based programming with XML and RDF and provide a basis
for the implementation of Web objects and their manipulation in industrial
rule systems.</p>

<p><strong>BRML</strong> (Business Rules Markup Language) is an 'XML Rule
Interlingua for Agent Communication, based on Courteous/Ordinary Logic
Programs.' It has been used in connection with 'CommonRules' from IBM, and
was developed in connection with IBM's Business Rules for E-Commerce
Project.</p>

<p>Recent work in OWL and RDF Query is being considered</p>

<p>Participants in the RuleML Initiative have expressed an urgent need for a
standard rule markup language, with translators in and out along with further
tools. This need provided the impetus for the RuleML effort.</p>

<h3><a id="section_1_3" name="section_1_3">1.3 The Rule Markup
Initiative</a></h3>

<p>The RuleML Initiative started in August 2000 during the Pacific Rim
International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (<a
href="http://www3.cm.deakin.edu.au/pricai/frames/main.html">PRICAI 2000</a>).
It has brought together expert teams from several countries, including
leaders in Knowledge Representation and Markup Languages, from both academia
and industry. The RuleML Initiative is developing an open, vendor neutral
XML/RDF-based rule language. This will allow for the exchange of rules
between various systems including distributed software components on the Web,
heterogeneous client-server systems found within large corporations, etc. The
RuleML language offers XML syntax for rules Knowledge Representation,
interoperable among major commercial and non-commercial rules systems.</p>

<p>Among our industrial participants are rules engine vendors, Web technology
vendors, XML/RDF tools vendors and also technology users such as financial
corporations, telecom companies and some of the major Web portals and ASPs.
The RuleML Initiative is collaborating with numerous related efforts such as
the complementary Java Rules Engine API specification, the W3C RDF working
group, the DAML group, W3C P3P Activity, PMML, and many others. This
collaboration will enable RuleML to share mechanisms and provide a rules
language to existing and emerging industry standards such as the Semantic Web
and RDF, P3P, CC/PP and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). The scenario in
Appendix 1 exemplifies some inferential and metadata uses of RuleML for the
Semantic Web.</p>

<h2><a id="section_4" name="section_4">4. The Kernel Datalog
Sublanguage</a></h2>

<p>The Datalog (constructor-function-free) sublanguage of Horn logic is the
foundation for the kernel of <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/">RuleML</a>.
Datalog is the language in the intersection of <a
href="http://www.sql.org/">SQL</a> and <a
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~deransar/prolog/docs.html">Prolog</a>. It can
thus be considered as the subset of logic programming needed for representing
the information of null-value-free relational databases, including
(recursive) views. That is, in Datalog we can define <span
style="font-style: italic">facts</span> corresponding to explicit rows of
relational tables and <span style="font-style: italic">rules</span>
corresponding to tables defined implictly by views.</p>

<p>RuleML Datalog, being a markup language, can conveniently represent
relational information where all of the columns are natural-language phrases.
To explain the Datalog features we will develop a small example formalizing
natural-language business rules in RuleML. This example correspond to the
'Eligibility' Category of Terry Moriarty's <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/12/rules-ws/paper/35/">Business Rule
Classification</a>.</p>

<p>Consider the English sentence</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">"Peter Miller's spending has been min
5000 euro in the previous year."</span></p>

<p>It can be marked up as the following RuleML Datalog fact:</p>
<pre>&lt;Atom&gt;
  &lt;Rel&gt;spending&lt;/Rel&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;min 5000 euro&lt;/Ind&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;previous year&lt;/Ind&gt;
&lt;/Atom&gt;</pre>

<p>This markup can be regarded as a kind of parse tree, where tags correspond
to non-terminals labeling both inner nodes (oval, RDF-like anonymous
resources), e.g. with 'Atom', and leaf nodes (rectangular, RDF-like literals
containing PCDATA that correspond to terminals), e.g. with 'Rel':</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.ruleml.org/papers/spending_atom.GIF"></p>

<p>Going through the tags from inside out, we find that <span
style="font-style: italic">"spending"</span> is marked up as the relation
name (table name) for the fact: <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;spending&lt;/Rel&gt;</span>. On the
same level, the three phrases <span style="font-style: italic">"</span><span
style="font-style: italic">Peter Miller"</span>, <span
style="font-style: italic">"min 5000 euro"</span>, and <span
style="font-style: italic">"previous year"</span> are marked up as individual
constants that are the three arguments (table columns) of the relation, in
the given sequence: <span style="font-family: courier">&lt;Ind&gt;Peter
Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;, &lt;Ind&gt;min 5000 euro&lt;/Ind&gt;, and
&lt;Ind&gt;previous year&lt;/Ind&gt;</span>. The entire relation application
constitutes an atomic formula, marked up by <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Atom&gt;</span> ... <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;/Atom&gt;</span>.</p>

<p>In the above Datalog markup, the three<span
style="font-family: courier; font-style: italic"></span><span
style="font-style: italic">"spending"</span> arguments are not further
analyzed; they are considered as just names of individual constants. For
identification purposes, they would need to be repeated verbatim by a query
that is to retrieve the above fact (as illustrated by the query in the body
of rule below). A step-wise refining analysis could exhibit the internal
structure and natural-language meaning of the basic three arguments using
further, auxiliary, arguments, or going beyond Datalog, with all steps marked
up in RuleML.</p>

<p>Notice that in the RuleML Datalog kernel a relation can be n-ary, i.e.
have any fixed number, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., of arguments. The unary/binary
restriction of Datalog is an important special case, e.g. for combining
RuleML with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL</a>, as in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/SUBM-SWRL-20040521/">SWRL</a>. While
the above markup uses one 3-ary<span
style="font-family: courier; font-style: italic"></span><span
style="font-style: italic">"spending"</span> relation, it could also be
reduced to three binary relations branching off from an individual constant
that stands for the ternary relationship, as shown in a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/">W3C Working Draft</a>.
Moreover, RuleML Datalog provides for the markup of null values via empty
individuals, &lt;Ind/&gt;.</p>

<p>Now consider the English sentence</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">"A customer is premium if their spending
has been min 5000 euro in the previous year."</span></p>

<p>This can be marked up as the following RuleML Datalog rule (an
implication):</p>
<pre>&lt;Implies&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;Atom&gt;
      &lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;
      &lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;
    &lt;/At//atom&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;Atom&gt;
      &lt;Rel&gt;spending&lt;/Rel&gt;
      &lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;
      &lt;Ind&gt;min 5000 euro&lt;/Ind&gt;
      &lt;Ind&gt;previous year&lt;/Ind&gt;
    &lt;/Atom&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/Implies&gt;</pre>

<p>Like for the fact, this rule markup can be viewed as a parse tree:</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.ruleml.org/papers/premium_implies.GIF"></p>

<p>Looking at these tags, notice that RuleML follows the Java
class-vs.-method naming convention by distinguishing upper-case <em>type
tags</em> from lower-case <em>role tags</em>. The atomic formula within the
&lt;body&gt; role of the &lt;Implies&gt; is like the &lt;Atom&gt;
constituting the above fact, except that <span>&lt;Ind&gt;Peter
Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;</span> is replaced by <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;</span>, the
markup of a variable named <span
style="font-style: italic; font-family: courier">"customer"</span>. This
variable also occurs in an &lt;Atom&gt; within the &lt;head&gt; role of the
&lt;Implies&gt;, which applies the unary relation<span
style="font-family: courier; font-style: normal">&lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;</span>
to &lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;<span
style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>

<p>The rule and the fact can be used together for a first derivation example:
The rule's body matches the fact, binding <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;</span> to <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Ind&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;</span>;
using this binding to instantiate the same variable in the rule's head, a new
&lt;Atom&gt; is derived expressing that <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Ind&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;</span> is a
<span style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;</span>
customer.</p>

<p>Besides using a single atomic formula in the body, a RuleML Datalog rule
can also use an entire conjunction of atoms. This will allow complex
conditions via 'and-ed' atoms, which can involve various variables.</p>

<p>As an example with a body 'and-ing' two atoms, consider the English
sentence</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">"The discount for a customer buying a
product is 7.5 percent if the customer is premium and the product is
luxury."</span></p>

<p>It can be marked up as the following RuleML Datalog (implication) rule:</p>
<pre>&lt;Implies&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;Atom&gt;
      &lt;Rel&gt;discount&lt;/Rel&gt;
      &lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;
      &lt;Var&gt;product&lt;/Var&gt;
      &lt;Ind&gt;7.5 percent&lt;/Ind&gt;
    &lt;/Atom&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;And&gt;
      &lt;Atom&gt;
        &lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;
        &lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;
      &lt;/Atom&gt;
      &lt;Atom&gt;
        &lt;Rel&gt;luxury&lt;/Rel&gt;
        &lt;Var&gt;product&lt;/Var&gt;
      &lt;/Atom&gt;
    &lt;/And&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/Implies&gt;</pre>

<p>Viewed as a parse tree, this markup contains an 'and' branch with atomic
subtrees:</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.ruleml.org/papers/discount_implies.GIF"></p>

<p>The main &lt;Implies&gt; tag here has a body whose &lt;And&gt; conjoins
the <span style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;</span>
atom of the earlier rule and a similar <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;luxury&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> atom; they
are used for tests over two different variables. The rule's head is an atom
applying a <span style="font-style: italic">"discount"</span> relation to
these two variables and to an individual constant that marks up <span
style="font-style: italic">"7.5 percent"</span>.</p>

<p>While <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> was
defined by our first rule, <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;luxury&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> could be
(partially) defined as</p>

<p>"A Porsche is luxury."</p>

<p>by another RuleML Datalog fact:</p>
<pre>&lt;Atom&gt;
  &lt;Rel&gt;luxury&lt;/Rel&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;Porsche&lt;/Ind&gt;
&lt;/Atom&gt;</pre>

<p>Again, this fact markup can be viewed as a parse tree:</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.ruleml.org/papers/luxury_atom.GIF"></p>

<p>The new rule and fact can augment our earlier rule and fact for a <span
style="font-style: italic">chaining</span> derivation example as follows: The
first conjunct of the <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;discount&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> rule's
body chains to the <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;premium&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> rule,
which succeeds as shown earlier, binding<span
style="font-family: courier"></span><span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Var&gt;customer&lt;/Var&gt;</span> to <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Ind&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;</span>. The
second conjunct just matches the <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;luxury&lt;/Rel&gt;</span> fact,
binding <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Var&gt;product&lt;/Var&gt;</span> to <span
style="font-family: courier">&lt;Ind&gt;Porsche&lt;/Ind&gt;</span>. So, the
<span style="font-family: courier">&lt;Rel&gt;discount&lt;/Rel&gt;</span>
rule succeeds with those bindings, proving an atom shown here with its
translation to English:</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">"The discount for Peter Miller buying a
Porsche is 7.5 percent."</span></p>

<p>This derived atom markup may be stored for further processing:</p>
<pre>&lt;Atom&gt;
  &lt;Rel&gt;discount&lt;/Rel&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/Ind&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;Porsche&lt;/Ind&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;7.5 percent&lt;/Ind&gt;
&lt;/Atom&gt;</pre>

<p>As always, such markup can be viewed as a parse tree:</p>

<p> <img src="http://www.ruleml.org/papers/discount_atom.GIF"></p>

<p>Notice that we explained the first rule in a bottom-up manner and the
second rule in a top-down manner. Actually, each rule can be used in both
ways; the RuleML kernel is neutral with respect to any use direction.</p>

<p>RuleML uses Datalog as the kernel of its <a
href="http://www.ruleml.org/modularization/#Model">family of
sublanguages</a>. Its syntax is defined by an <a
href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.88/xsd/datalog.xsd">XML Schema</a>. Its
semantics is defined via Herbrand models. Various RuleML Datalog
implementations exist, including one as part of <a

Applications</a></h2>

<p>The RuleML Initiative offers decades of collective industrial and academic
experience of its members in the development and deployment of rule-based
applications in various domains such as finance, retail, product
configuration, e-contracting, personalization, help desk, electronic
commerce, etc.</p>

<p>During the last few years, the Initiative lead an effort to collect use
cases and prototype rule bases to be used for testing and refining the
requirements of the RuleML family of sublanguages. A library of use cases is
available at the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org">RuleML Web Site</a></p>
. 

<p>The use cases presented in this section illustrate some of the RuleML
Language features and serve as a repository for further tests and
requirements on RuleML tools.</p>

<h3><a id="section_16_2" name="section_16_2">16.2 Animals Rulebase</a></h3>

<p>The animals rulebase is a simple rulebase with a good number of rules of
average complexity. This use case illustrates the implementation of a RuleML
rulebase that can be used in both forward and backward chaining engines. The
animals rulebase also lends itself to a query rules engine implementation. It
is a also a good starting point for people to get used to the RuleML basic
concepts and syntax.</p>

<p>The rulebase contains 6 initial facts and 15 rules. The fact <em>"Stretch
chews cud"</em> is implemented in RuleML as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;Atom&gt;
  &lt;oid&gt;&lt;Ind&gt;fact2&lt;/Ind&gt;&lt;/oid&gt;
  &lt;Rel&gt;chews&lt;/Rel&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;Stretch&lt;/Ind&gt;
  &lt;Ind&gt;cud&lt;/Ind&gt;
&lt;/Atom&gt;</pre>

<p>The following rule: "If an animal X gives milk then X is a mammal" is
implemented in RuleML 0.8 as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;Implies&gt;
   &lt;oid&gt;&lt;Ind&gt;AnimalsRule2&lt;/Ind&gt;&lt;/oid&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;Atom&gt;
         &lt;Rel&gt;isa&lt;/RerererRel&gt;
         &lt;Var&gt;x&lt;/Var&gt;
         &lt;Ind&gt;mammal&lt;/Ind&gt;
      &lt;/Atom&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;Atom&gt;
         &lt;Rel&gt;gives&lt;/Rel&gt;
         &lt;Var&gt;x&lt;/Var&gt;
         &lt;Ind&gt;milk&lt;/Ind&gt;
      &lt;/Atom&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;

<p>The GEnealogical Data COMmunication (GEDCOM) is a data model, normalized
with no information duplicated between Individual and Family instances. The
<a href="http://www.daml.org/2001/01/gedcom/gedcom.daml">DAML gedcom
ontology</a> was based on this data model. With GEDCOM, Mike Dean created the
first operational RuleML (0.7) rulebase, later ported to RuleML 0.8 by Harold
Boley. GEDCOM implements rules on family relationships (child, spouse, etc.),
run via XSLT translators to the <a
href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/home.php">XSB</a>, <a
href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/">JESS</a>, and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm">n3/cwm</a> engines. Besides
indirectly, via translators, RuleML implementations should also be done
directly, via rules inference engines and query applications.</p>
