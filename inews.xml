<p>
Rules in (and for) the Web have become a mainstream topic since
<i>inference rules</i> were <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/rules/home.html">marked up for E-Commerce</a> and were identified as a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html">Design Issue</a> of the
<a href="http://www.semanticweb.org/">Semantic Web</a>, and since <i>transformation rules</i> were put to practice for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javaxml/chapter/ch09.html">document generation from a central XML repository</a> (<a href="#Practice-Preach">as used here</a>).
Moreover, rules have continued to play an important role in
<a href="http://www.mailgate.org/comp/comp.ai.shells/">AI shells</a> for knowledge-based systems and
in <a href="http://agents.umbc.edu/">Intelligent Agents</a>, today both needing a Web interchange format,
and such XML/RDF-standardized rules are now also usable for the declarative specification of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/">Web Services</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Rule Markup Initiative has taken steps towards defining
a shared Rule Markup Language (RuleML),
permitting both forward (bottom-up) and backward (top-down) rules in XML
for deduction, rewriting, and further inferential-transformational tasks.
The initiative started during
<a href="http://www3.cm.deakin.edu.au/pricai/">PRICAI 2000</a>,
as described in the <a href="RuleML/sld001.htm">Original RuleML Slide</a>,
and was
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.prolog/browse_thread/thread/41090fff5c9f08ca/1e45a73b28d5483f">launched</a>
in the Internet on 2000-11-10.
Besides the previous <a href="indtd.html">XML-only RuleML</a> and
the current <a href="inspec">XML/RDF-combining RuleML</a>,
there is also an approach towards an <a href="#RDF">RDF-only RuleML</a>.
<a href="#Engines">Complementary efforts</a>
consist of the development of (Java-based) rule engines such as <a href="http://www.jdrew.org/">jDREW</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mandarax">Mandarax</a> RuleML,
as well as XSB-RDF RuleML.
RuleML's earlier <a href="#Design">design</a>
evolved into <a href="#DTDs-Schemas">DTDs-Schemas</a>
for positional-slotted RuleML sublanguages including <a href="indoo">Object-Oriented RuleML (OO RuleML)</a>.
Efforts also went into defining <a href="http://www.omg.org/docs/br/03-10-02.pdf">MOF-RuleML: The Abstract Syntax of RuleML as a MOF Model</a>.

  <item>The International RuleML Symposium on Rule Interchange and Applications
(<a href="http://2008.ruleml.org">RuleML-2008</a>) 
will take place, October 30-31, 2008, in Orlando, Florida,
co-located with the 11th International Business Rules Forum (<a href="http://www.businessrulesforum.com">BR Forum</a>).
RuleML-2008, is the primary venue to discuss and exchange new ideas, practical developments and experiences
on issues pertinent to the interchange and applications of rules in open distributed environments such as the Web.
RuleML-2008 will enable delegates to better understand Web Rules and Rule-Based Event Processing technologies and their potential,
and how to exploit these technologies in their organizations. 
A RuleML-2008 Challenge with prizes will be organized to demonstrate tools, use cases, case studies and applications.
Make RuleML-2008 your Web Rules showcase!

  <item>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION: The 2008 International RuleML Symposium on Rule Interchange and Applications
(<a href="http://2008.ruleml.org">RuleML-2008</a>) will take place, October 30-31, 2008, in Orlando, Florida,
co-located with The 11th International

Applications.
The RuleML-2008 Challenge provides an excellent opportunity to
demonstrate rule-based tools, use cases, and applications (and to win a
prize). Late-breaking Challenge/Showcase Demos are still possible, 
along with Lightning/Highlight Talks &amp; Fast Abstracts. All the details for
