      <p> The RuleML Initiative is an international non-profit organization covering all aspects of
               Web rules and their interoperation, with a <a href="#Structure">Structure</a> and Technical
         Groups that center on RuleML specification, tool, and application development. Around RuleML,
               an open network of individuals and groups from both industry and academia has emerged, having
               a shared interest in modern rule topics, including the interoperation of Semantic Web rules.
               The RuleML Initiative has been collaborating with OASIS on <a href="http://www.legalxml.org/">Legal XML</a>, <a href="http://policy.ruleml.org/">Policy RuleML</a>, <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml">LegalRuleML</a>, and related efforts since 2004. The Initiative has further been
               interacting with the developers of ISO Common Logic (<a href="http://cl.tamu.edu/">CL</a>),
               which became an International Standard, First edition, in October 2007. RuleML is also a
               member of OMG, contributing to its Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR/">SBVR</a>), which went into Version 1.0 in January 2008,
               and to its Production Rule Representation (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/PRR/">PRR</a>),
               which went into Version 1.0 in December 2009. Moreover, participants of the RuleML Initiative
               have supported the development of the W3C Rule Interchange Format (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/RIF_Working_Group">RIF</a>), which attained
               Recommendation status in June 2010. The annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuleML_Symposium">RuleML Symposium</a> has taken the lead
               in bringing together delegates from industry and academia who share this interest focus in Web
               rules. 
      </p>
          
      <p> RuleML (Rule Markup Language, which has also become a Rule Modeling Language and a <a href="http://ruleml.org/metalogic/">Rule MetaLogic</a>) is a unifying family of
               XML-serialized rule languages spanning across all industrially relevant kinds of Web rules. As
               a research-based language family, RuleML acts as the connector between <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/RIF_Working_Group">RIF</a> -- via the emerging <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/RIF_FAQ#What_is_the_relationship_between_RuleML_and_RIF.3F">RIF RuleML</a> subfamily -- and <a href="http://common-logic.org/">Common Logic</a> -- via
               the planned <a href="http://philebus.tamu.edu/pipermail/cl/2010-October/002179.html">CL
                    RuleML</a> subfamily. As an industry-focused de facto standard, RuleML has become the
               overarching specification of Web rules crosss-fertilizing with corresponding OMG
               specifications (mainly <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR/">SBVR</a> and <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/PRR/">PRR</a>) and constituting the foundation of an OASIS
               specification (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml">LegalRuleML</a>). Through its participation in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWSF-SWSL/">SWSL</a>, RuleML has already
               accommodated and extended other rule languages, building interoperation bridges between them.
               The current <a href="#Specification">Specification</a> of RuleML is <a href="/1.0/">Version
                    1.0</a>.

                        <b>Mission Statement:</b>
                        
                  <p> The goal of the Rule Markup Initiative is to develop RuleML as the canonical Web language
                             for rules using XML markup, formal semantics, and efficient implementations. 
                  </p>
                        
                  <p> RuleML covers the entire rule spectrum, from derivation rules to transformation rules to
                             reaction rules. RuleML can thus specify queries and inferences in Web ontologies, mappings
                             between Web ontologies, and dynamic Web behaviors of workflows, services, and agents. 
                  </p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Mission Approach:</b>
                        
                  <p> Rather than focusing on academic research prototypes, RuleML is about rule interoperation
                             between industry standards (such as JSR 94, SQL'99, OCL, BPMI, WSFL, XLang, XQuery, RQL,
                             OWL, DAML-S, and ISO Prolog) as well as established systems (CLIPS, Jess, ILOG JRules, Blaze
                             Advisor, Versata, MQWorkFlow, BizTalk, Savvion, etc.). 
                  </p>
                        
                  <p> The Initiative develops a modular RuleML specification and transformations from and to
                             other rule standards/systems. Moreover, it coordinates the development of tools to elicit,
                             maintain, and execute RuleML rules. It also collects use cases, e.g. on business rules and
                             reactive services.

      <p> The <a href="#Participants-Logos">participants</a> of the RuleML Initiative constitute an
               open network of individuals and groups from both industry and academia. We are not commencing
               from zero but have done some work related to rule markup or have actually proposed some
               specific tag set for rules. Our main objective is to provide a basis for an integrated
               rule-markup approach that will be beneficial to all involved and to the rule community at
               large. This shall be achieved by having all participants collaborate in establishing
               translations between existing tag sets and in converging on a shared rule-markup vocabulary.
               This RuleML kernel language can serve as a specification for immediate rule interchange and
               can be gradually extended - possibly together with <a href="#Related">related initiatives</a>

               combination of both. Being in the third, 'semiformal' category, the RuleML Initiative is
               working towards an XML-based markup language that permits Web-based rule storage, interchange,
               retrieval, and firing/application.

      <p> Markup standards and initiatives related to RuleML include: 
         <ul>
                    
            <li>Mathematical Markup Language (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>): However,
                         MathML's <i>Content Markup</i> is better suited for defining functions rather than
                         relations or general rules 
            </li>
                    
            <li>DARPA Agent Markup Language (<a href="http://www.daml.org/">DAML</a>): While the
                         contributing <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/SHOE/">SHOE project</a> has
                         permitted Horn rules and a DAML-RULES is planned, the current <a href="http://www.daml.org/language/">DAML+OIL</a> (March 2001) does not yet include a
                         specification of explicit inference rules 
            </li>
                    
            <li>Predictive Model Markup Language (<a href="http://www.dmg.org/html/pmml_v1_1.html">PMML</a>): With this XML-based language one can define and share various models for
                         data-mining results, including <a href="http://www.dmg.org/html/assocrules.html">association rules</a>
                       
            </li>
                    
            <li>Attribute Grammars in XML (<a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~boley/xmlag/attgramm/sld001.htm">AG-markup</a>): For
                         AG's semantic rules, there are various possible XML markups that are similar to Horn-rule
                         markup 
            </li>
                    
            <li>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>): This is a restricted term-rewriting system of rules, written in XML, for
                         transforming XML documents into other XML documents 
            </li>

      <p> 2001-05-11: "RuleML, the emerging standards effort on XML Rules knowledge representation,
               continues to progress in its design -- and also in its acceptance; notably, IBM this past
               month joined as participant and publicly disclosed that it is prototyping support for RuleML.
               Presentation materials from two recent W3C meetings, and a new short overview conference
               paper, are now available: see <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/bgrosof/#XMLRules">http://ebusiness.mit.edu/bgrosof/#XMLRules</a>." (Also see: <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/commonrules">alphaWorks Posting</a>. Contact: <a href="mailto:hychan@us.ibm.com">Hoi Chan</a>.)

      <p> Some <a href="insteps.html">initial steps taken by the RuleML Initiative</a> have been to
               structure the area of rule markup, to raise issues and identify tasks, and to propose
               tentative rule tags/attributes.

      <h2><a name="Queries">Queries</a></h2>
          
      
          
      <p> As in many deduction approaches, RuleML queries are regarded as headless implications,
               symmetrically to regarding facts as bodiless implications. They enumerate the bindings of all
               their free (existentially interpreted) variables. 
      </p>
          
      <p> Queries were added to RuleML 0.8 as a third top-level element of rulebases besides facts and
               imps (since this extension is purely additive, all queriless RuleML 0.8 rulebases should still
               validate). This gives us "for free" all refinements of RuleML's existing system of
               sublanguages via the _body role of queries: because of RuleML's DTD inheritance, additions
               were only required for <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-datalog.dtd">ruleml-datalog.dtd</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-datalog.dtd.txt">ruleml-datalog.dtd.txt</a>) and <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-urcbindatagroundfact.dtd">urcbindatagroundfact.dtd</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-urcbindatagroundfact.dtd.txt">urcbindatagroundfact.dtd.txt</a>). In particular, <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-datalog.dtd">ruleml-datalog.dtd</a>'s
               query-extended rulebase definition is inherited by <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/dtd/0.8/ruleml-hornlog.dtd">ruleml-hornlog.dtd</a>, where
               queries in datalog use only inds and vars but queries in hornlog automatically also permit
               cterms (because hornlog atoms permit cterms). 
      </p>
          
      <p> RuleML queries are illustrated by our business-rule example <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/discount.ruleml">discount.ruleml</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/discount.ruleml.txt">discount.ruleml.txt</a>) and by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Eric/">Eric Prud'hommeaux</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/">RDF Query example</a>
               <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/wsdl-rdf-query.ruleml">wsdl-rdf-query.ruleml</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/wsdl-rdf-query.ruleml.txt">wsdl-rdf-query.ruleml.txt</a>). 
      </p>
          
      <p> This query incorporation into RuleML assumes that the sublanguage expressiveness should be
               the same for 'assertions' (facts and imps) and for the 'requests' (queries) on them. So, it
               cannot, e.g., express queries on ground triples (containing no variables) via non-ground
               triples (containing variables): <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/creator.ruleml">creator.ruleml</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/0.8/creator.ruleml.txt">creator.ruleml.txt</a>). However, users can still employ one rulebase (module) with its DTD
               for 'assertions', and another rulebase (module) with a different DTD for 'requests'.

               <a href="http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/roman/ruleml/">ASP RuleML</a> defines a sublanguage
               of RuleML for answer-set programs in XML Schema. This variant facilitates the specification of
               a number of ASP-related constructs in a general manner. Moreover, it constitutes a base
               language for specific ASP extensions, such as HEX-programs.

               given a first-order model-theoretic foundation (<a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/papers/SemanticsPsoaRules.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/talks/SemanticsPsoaRules-talk-UNB2011.pdf">slides</a>),
               blending slot distribution, as in <a href="#RIF">RIF</a>, with integrated psoa terms, as in
               RuleML. In order to support reasoning in PSOA RuleML, the implemention of the <a href="http://reubenpeterpaul.github.com/PSOA-to-TPTP/">PSOA2TPTP</a> translator is in
               progress, which maps PSOA RuleML knowledge bases to the <a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/QuickGuide/">TPTP</a> format, as widely used for
               theorem provers. With this translator, reasoning in PSOA RuleML is available using the <a href="http://riazanov.webs.com/software.htm">VampirePrime</a> prover. The composition of

      <p> 2001-06-20: <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~sintek/">Michael Sintek</a> has implemented
               a (Java) parser for an RDF version of the Horn-logic subset of RuleML 0.8; it reflects an RDF
               RuleML syntax by (Java) classes that currently generate textual Horn clauses but could be
               adapted for generating the XML RuleML syntax: <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/frodo/rdf2java/">The FRODO rdf2java Tool</a>. A converse
               translator from XML RuleML 0.8 to RDF RuleML 0.8 should be easier to write in XSLT than was

      <p> The <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/fol/">FOL RuleML</a> language has been developed in
               interaction between the <a href="#Structure">RuleML Steering Committee</a> and the <a href="http://www.daml.org/committee/">Joint Committee</a>, with input from <a href="http://philebus.tamu.edu/mailman/listinfo/scl">Simplified Common Logic (SCL)</a>. FOL
               RuleML shares/reuses most of the earlier RuleML LP syntax, incorporating First-Order-Logic
               quantifiers and disjunctions as well as equivalence and negation. FOL RuleML strives for a
               strict separation of declarative content from procedural (Assert, Query) performatives, as
               pioneered by KQML. This and further changes to the current <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.87/">RuleML 0.87</a> will also benefit other sublanguages
               towards RuleML 0.9, in particular the Horn logic subset. FOL RuleML is the rule component of
                 <a href="http://www.daml.org/2004/11/fol/">SWRL FOL</a> and a proposed FOL content language
               for <a href="http://www.swsi.org/">SWSI</a>. It can be viewed as a generalization of SWRL FOL
               in that it is an XML form of full FOL, with n-ary relations (predicate symbols) and
               constructors (logical function symbols).

               It's a servlet (running in Tomcat) that receives RuleML rulebases in RDF RuleML syntax (since

               together with some queries, evaluates them with XSB Prolog (in auto-tabling mode, which should
               be equivalent to bottom-up evaluation!), and returns the result as an HTML page containing the
               bindings as facts of instantiated queries. A future version must, of course, return a RuleML
               file. Simply try <a href="http://serv-4100.dfki.uni-kl.de:8765/ruleml/">this URL</a>. Click on
               'example' and paste the RDF RuleML popping up into the input window (note that pasting XML/RDF
               cannot be directly done in IE, only in Netscape; use "view source" in IE). Alternatively, you

               support for modalities and proof exporting. DR-Device is a defeasible logic reasoning system
               with priorities among rules, two types of negation (strong, default) and conflicting (mutually
               exclusive) literals. The system is implemented on top of CLIPS and has been extended to
               introduce rule modes that determine the modality of the conclusion and modalized literals in
               the premises of rule bodies. Furthermore, the system exports in a formal RuleML-like
               representation an explanation for the proof of the rule program conclusions. The aim is (a) to
               take advantage of the expressive power of modal logics to define various agent behaviors, and
               (b) to to increase user/agent trust towards rule-based Semantic Web applications.

      <p> The Graph inscribed logic (<a href="http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Grailog">Grailog</a>) was initially developed for the course <a href="https://www.ict.tuwien.ac.at/lva/Boley_LFCS/index.html">Logical Foundations of
                    Cognitive Science</a> and has since much evolved, as presented in a series of talks,
               including <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PhiloWeb/rule-ml-grailog">RuleML/Grailog: The
                    Rule Metalogic Visualized with Generalized Graphs</a> at <a href="http://web-and-philosophy.org/philoweb2011_pt-ai_salonica/">PhiloWeb 2011</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/talks/RuleMLGrailog-OMG.pdf">The Grailog User Interface
                    for Knowledge Bases of Ontologies &amp; Rules</a> at <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/agendas/ma-12/Ontology.pdf">OMGCambridge2012</a>.

               <b>The newest edition of Grailog is being maintained in presentable form: <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/talks/RuleMLGrailog.pdf">RuleMLGrailog.pdf</a> (<a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/talks/RuleMLGrailog.ppt">RuleMLGrailog.ppt</a>)</b>
             
      </p>
          
      <p> RuleML/Grailog comes with a mapping from (2-dimensional, 'analogical') generalized graphs to
               a RuleML/POSL-type (1-dimensional, 'symbolic') logic generalized to an expressive <a href="http://ruleml.org/metalogic/">Rule Metalogic</a>. The transition from RuleML/Grailog
               to RuleML/POSL to RuleML/XML proceeds in the direction from <i>human</i>-oriented to
                 <i>machine</i>-oriented syntaxes. Since a translator from RuleML/POSL to RuleML/XML already
               exists (see <a href="#POSL">POSL</a>), its three components (i.e., its source RuleML/POSL, its
               target RuleML/XML, and the translator itself) could be generalized to cover full
               RuleML/Grailog expressiveness, and a translator from RuleML/Grailog to RuleML/XML could then
               be obtained by implementing a translator from RuleML/Grailog (in an appropriate format) to the
               generalized RuleML/POSL. Alternatively, a translator from RuleML/Grailog (maybe in SVG/XML)
               directly to the generalized RuleML/XML could be implemented. Subsets of Grailog corresponding
               to Datalog and Hornlog RuleML will be natural starting points for such an open source
               translator project. Everyone who is interested in the further development of Grailog or its
               translators, please contact <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/">Harold Boley</a>.

      <p> RuleML Participant Jens Dietrich's Oryx (version 2.1) has a graphical Knowledge Editor for
               business rules and a Repository that contains the description of predicates, functions, and
               database connections. "Oryx works with open XML based formats, support for the emerging RuleML
               standard and the open source Mandarax XKB 1.0 format is included." (<a href="http://www.jbdietrich.com/">http://www.jbdietrich.com</a>).

      <p> 2005-12-13: A team led by <a href="http://www.csd.auth.gr/~nbassili">Nick Bassiliades</a>
               and <a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/~antoniou/">Grigoris Antoniou</a> has released <a href="http://iskp.csd.auth.gr/systems/dr-device.html">VDR-Device (version 0.27)</a>.
               VDR-Device is a visual environment for developing defeasible logic rule bases for the Semantic
               Web. VDR-Device integrates a graphical RuleML-compliant rule editor and a defeasible reasoning
               system that processes RDF data and RDF Schema ontologies. The rule editor constrains the
               allowed vocabulary after analyzing the input RDF Schema ontologies, preventing potential
               syntactic and semantic errors. The reasoning system supports all defeasible logic rule types,
               priorities among rules, two types of negation and conflicting literals.

      <p> 2006-04-28: A Java Web Start application called <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/translator">TRANSLATOR</a> has been developed by David Hirtle for translating from <a href="http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/attempto/">Attempto Controlled English</a> to RuleML. The

      <p> 2009-12-08: S2REd is a syntactic+semantic text-based RuleML editor. It is a full-fledged
               textual XML editor that features: syntax highlighting, spell checking, brace matching,
               code-block coloring, pretty-printing, well-formedness and validation checking. Nevertheless,
               S2REd is more than an XML editor: it&#146;s a tool totally dedicated to RuleML authoring, offering

               possible. If you have an entry, please send us its pointer. The discounting business rules
