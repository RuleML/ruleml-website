<h1>RuleML in RDF</h1>

<p>
This is an experimental RDF translator for a subset or RuleML.
</p>
  <h2>Sections</h2><ul><li><a href="#Overview">Overview</a><li><a href="#Explanations">Explanations</a></ul><h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
RDF-like 'resources' can be represented in RuleML as 'ur' elements and
triples can be represented as special, 'ur'-centered facts (see e.g. <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld009.htm">KR Principles and DTD Modularization</a>). Vice versa,
RuleML rules can be represented in RDF, e.g. through the generation results
of the experimental translator described here (you may also start from <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/RuleML-RDF/sld013.htm">RDF Relationships and DTD Modularization</a>).
</p>
<p>
In order to be flexible w.r.t future changes of the RuleML DTD,
the current RDF version of RuleML is defined by an XSLT stylesheet
translating RuleML rules to RDF.
The translation, based on Cocoon 1.8, can already be fed into RDF tools
such as the RDFViz data grapher.
</p>
<p>
The RDF representation directly reflects the tree structure of RuleML
rulebases as defined by the RuleML DTD. For this, the abbreviated RDF
syntax (similar to nested property lists) is used which nests subtrees
and uses types as rdf:Descriptions:
A particular rulebase becomes an RDF resource of type ruleml:Rulebase
with an rdf:Container property leading to its rdf:Bag of rules labeled
rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ...
A ruleml:If rule has ruleml:Conc and ruleml:Prem properties leading to
ruleml:Atom or ruleml:And resources. Etc., down to RuleML's PCDATA for
relation symbols, individual constants, and variables, etc., which become
corresponding resources with ruleml:Name literals in RDF.
</p>
<p>
The RDF graphs generated in this way become quite large, due to the
various intermediate layers of nodes. E.g., the own example becomes
228 lines of pretty-printed RDF/XML, 166 RDF triples, and an 8-page RDFViz graph.
Perhaps (some of) the node layers may be
collapsed to obtain more compact RDF graphs. (Also, should the container
Bag be abolished in a future RDF version, it would be possible to
represent the bag content by unordered 'parallel' labeled arcs;
for the Seq container we would still need some 'order' labels
rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ...).
The XSLT stylesheet would then need to be adapted to the new output form.

<p>
The XSLT stylesheet <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/ruledf.xsl">ruledf.xsl</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/ruledf.xsl.txt">ruledf.xsl.txt</a>) implements the translator.
Its output can
be given to <a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf-dev/rudolf/rdfviz/">RDFViz</a> for visualization.
</p>
<p>
The RuleML <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/exa/own.ruleml.txt">own example</a> can be augmented by an XSLT prelude/prolog line,
obtaining <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/own.ruleml">own.ruleml</a> (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/own.ruleml.txt">own.ruleml.txt</a>). Running this through Cocoon leads to <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/own.rdf">own.rdf</a>.
The RDFViz visualization of the RDF version of the RuleML example
then leads to a large GIF image (<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/rdf/own-rdfviz.gif">own-rdfviz.gif</a>). For printing it on a
matrix of pages, it can first be inserted as graphics into a standard
spreadsheet program.
</p>
<p>
Known omissions:
<ul>
  <li>The generated URLs ending in .../if-gensym, .../if-gensym, .../conc-gensym, etc.
should really have a form like .../if-gen0001, .../if-gen0002, .../conc-gen0001, etc.
This could be implemented in XSLT using generate-id.
  
  <li>The RuleML tags ur and eq are still missing.
  
</ul>
