This query asks for all members (agents) of the virtual organization. This means, it
     retrieves all (implemented) members of the RuleML-2007 organization committee.

     These agents are defined and described as a role model in an external OWL ontology together with other
     infos about the virtual organization such as tasks, responsibility assignment matrix etc.
 
     The RuleML-2007 organizational agent (Prova inference service) by asking inference queries to
     this ontology collects the answers and sends them back to the requester.
