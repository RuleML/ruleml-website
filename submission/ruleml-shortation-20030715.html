<h2><a id="abstract" name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>

<p></p>

<p>This document describes a rule shorthand and presentation language that
merges Prolog's positional and F-logic's rolled syntaxes.
The positional-rolled (PR) syntax thus accomodates various propositional and object-oriented
modeling styles.
After an introduction, the document covers PR selectors,
unification, webizing, typing, and implementation.
The PR rule language is faster to
write and easier to read than any XML syntax for rules. However, since a
parser and generator map the PR syntax to Object-Oriented RuleML
and back,
the advantages of XML are fully preserved.</p>

<h2><a id="section_1" name="section_1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<div class="div2">
<p>Let us consider a Datalog rule as follows.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="div3">
<h3 style="font-size: 12pt"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Natural
Language:</span></strong></h3>

<div class="schema">

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><em><strong><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt">The discount for a customer buying a product is 5.0 percent if
     the customer is premium and the product is regular</span></strong></em></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="div2">

<div class="div3">
<h3 style="font-size: 12pt"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Prolog:</span></strong></h3>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(Customer,Product,"5.0 percent")  :-       
   premium(Customer), regular(Product).</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Note that this is a positional (ternary) discount relation, where you have
to remember -- e.g. for queries -- that the first argument is the customer, the second
is the product, and the third is the rebate obtained. This is in the spirit
of XML's ordered children. Also note that the comma infix within n-ary
relation applications for n>1 can be regarded as the order-imposing sequence
operator (while for n=0 and n=1 the sequencing degenerates).
</p>

<p>
Reliance on order can be avoided in the spirit of RDF, DL and F-logic by
introducing properties, attributes, or roles. For example, an F-logic-style
version of the above rule can be written as follows:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(cust->Customer;prod->Product;rebate->"5.0 percent") :-
   premium(cust->Customer), regular(prod->Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that in this object-centered ('object-oriented') modeling of relations
the semicolon infix indicates an unordered set of n slots, each consisting
of a 'role->filler' pair. Queries can now be posed without need for any
order information (however, knowledge of the role names cust, prod, rebate
is needed instead): Generalized (role) unification takes care of pairing
up identical roles before recursively unifying their fillers (we will go
into the issue of implicit/explicit 'rest' variables in the Unification section). The query
</p>


<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(rebate->Amount;prod->"Honda";cust->"Peter Miller")</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
thus succeeds if premium(cust->"Peter Miller") and regular(prod->"Honda")
were stored as facts, binding Amount to "5.0 percent". 
</p>

<p>
However, for unary relations like premium and regular, as well as for
some binary relations, the role (->) syntax may become cumbersome.
So in <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/indoo">Object-Oriented RuleML</a> we permit rules using both
ordered and object-oriented relations as premises as well as conclusions.
In the example, with an object-oriented discount relation and (degenerately)
ordered premium and regular relations, we obtain the following rule:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(cust->Customer;prod->Product;rebate->"5.0 percent") :-
   premium(Customer), regular(Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, suppose we start again with positional Datalog rules, but then
want to add optional spatio-temporal coordinates. Instead of extending
the argument sequences of all affected relations by further ordered
arguments, it may be preferable to add these extra bits in the unordered,
object-oriented way. Restricting the rule scope to the region of MA and
the period of 2003/04, our example thus becomes:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(Customer,Product,"5.0 percent";region->"MA";period->"2003/04") :-
   premium(Customer;period->"2003/04"), regular(Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Applying this rule, the query
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount("Peter Miller","Honda",Amount;period->When;region->Where)</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
succeeds if premium("Peter Miller";period->"2003/04") and regular("Honda")
were stored as facts, binding Amount to "5.0 percent", When to "2003/04",
and Where to "MA".
</p>

<p>
In general, we permit a single ordered sequence surrounded by two unordered subsets
of slots. All arguments together can thus be viewed as the union of the left and right subsets
and of the singleton set containing the slot seq->(ordered sequence) with the distinguished name 'seq'.
We thus assume that the 'ordered infix' "," has precedence over the 'unordered
infix' ";", so that the ordered ","-sequence <em>as a whole</em> is connected with the
"->" slot subsets to its left and/or right via bordering ";" infixes.
</p>

<p>
In the rule example, the ordered sequence (Customer,Product,"5.0 percent") has
has the slot set {region->"MA";period->"2003/04"} to its right.
</p>

<p>
Summarizing, an atom of the general form
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">p(r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN)</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
can be viewed as
</p>


<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">p(r1->f1;...;rL->fL;(e1,...,eM);rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN)</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
or as
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">p(r1->f1;...;rL->fL;seq->(e1,...,eM);rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN)</span></pre>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
For Hornlog rules, complex terms are enriched by roles in the same fashion.
</p>

<p>
Originally 'complex terms' are exactly what Prolog calls 'structures'. However, for clarity,
we use a distinction -- introduced in <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~vega/relfun.html">Relfun</a> -- between
(round) parentheses for active calls and [square] brackets
for passive structures; the latter can be seen as an obvious
generalization of Prolog's list notation via a polyadic struct constructor, so that
[e1,...,eM] is definable as struct[e1,...,eM].
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in general, the struct constructor can contain rolled slots besides the ordered sequence:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">struct[r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
This can be abbreviated by omitting the distinguished constructor name 'struct':
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">[r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
In Object-Oriented RuleML, we have permitted 'complex terms' with arbitrary constructors to <em>also</em>
contain unordered roles with their fillers,  or -- as in F-logic -- to <em>only</em>
contain such frame-like 'slots'. In that sense, this is a merger of Prolog and
F-logic.
</p>

<p>
In the example, the individual constant "5.0 percent" can be analyzed as the
cterm percent["5.0"], and the constant "2003/04" can be analyzed as either a
positional cterm interval["2003","2004"] or again as an object-oriented cterm
interval[start->"2003";end->"2004"]. Note that square brackets are preferable
here for cterms to clearly set them off from the parenthesized atoms.
</p>

<p>
Consistently substituting one of these cterms for the constant occurrences in the
above OO Datalog rule gives us either of the following OO Hornlog rules:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(Customer,Product,percent["5.0"];
         region->"MA";
         period->interval["2003","2004"])
 :-
    premium(Customer;period->interval["2003","2004"]),
    regular(Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(Customer,Product,percent["5.0"];
         region->"MA";
         period->interval[start->"2003";end->"2004"])
 :-
    premium(Customer;period->interval[start->"2003";end->"2004"]),
    regular(Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
These options are offered to accomodate various positional and object-oriented
modeling styles. They can all be marked up in OO RuleML.
</p>


<h2><a id="section_2" name="section_2">2. Selectors</a></h2>

<p>
A 'selector' in a unification-based language such as Prolog, Relfun, or
F-logic can be represented by a local unification and variable dereferencing for
the selected part of the complex data structure.
</p>

<p>
So we can access the start date of interval["2003","2004"] by unifying it with
interval[StartDate,EndDate] and dereferencing StartDate to "2003". Similarly, we
can access the end date of interval[start->"2003";end->"2004"] via unification
with interval[start->StartDate;end->EndDate] and dereferencing EndDate to "2004".
Unification will be treated in detail in the next section.
</p>

<p>
But instead of / in addition to this, we can introduce a 'universal' selector sel,
parameterized by either a positive integer or a role name.
</p>

<p>
sel[1](interval["2003","2004"]) would return "2003".
<br/>
sel[end](interval[start->"2003";end->"2004"]) would return "2004".
</p>

<p>
The general sel definition is easier to explain for normalized OO cterms, although
it also works for non-normalized ones.

<p>
Excluding rest variables, the most general kind of 'functional' OO cterms are 'left-and-right-rolled' cterms
of the form
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">c[r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
where 'functionality' means that the role names rJ taken from {r1,...,rN} are all
different.
</p>

<p>
Notice that a single sequence of positional elements e1,...,eM is surrounded by two
sets of unordered elements r1->f1;...;rL->fL and rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN.
</p>

<p>
These can be normalized to a 'left-rolled' cterm
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">c[r1->f1;...;rL->fL;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN;e1,...,eM]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
or to a 'right-rolled' cterm
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">c[e1,...,eM;r1->f1;...;rL->fL;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
(Further normalization by lexicographic sorting of the role names rJ would permit
'linear' term comparisons, but is out of scope here.)
</p>

<p>
Now, without loss of generality, for any right-rolled cterm
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">t = c[e1,...,eM;r1->f1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
we can introduce the universal selector sel, parameterized by either I or rJ:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">sel[I](t)  = eI    for  I  from {1,...,M}
sel[rJ](t) = fJ    for  rJ from {r1,...,rN}</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
As we have a direct representation of positional information in the e1,...,eM part,
we don't need here positive integers as role names in the r1->f1;...;rN->fN part,
although these or RDF's _1->e1;...;_M->eM could be used to simulate e1,...,eM.
(The other way round, slot[r1,f1],...,slot[rN,fN] plus normalization could simulate
r1->f1;...;rN->fN.)
</p>


<div class="div3">
<h2><a id="section_3" name="section_3">3. Unification</a></h2>

<p>
Unification of 'single' variables was already mentioned in the previous section.
This will be expanded here. Many languages with positional formulas such as Prolog use an explicit
'rest' variable in lists.
Some languages with rolled formulas such as F-logic use a convention of an implicit rest variable
in rolled terms, atoms, etc.
Proceeding to the PR syntax, both in the unification of both positional and rolled formulas, rest variables must be explicit.
</p> 

<p>
Without explicit rest variables,
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">interval[StartDate,EndDate] unifies with single variable X
                          by binding X = interval[StartDate,EndDate]

                          does not unify with the unary interval[X]

                          unifies with the binary interval[X,Y]
                          by binding StartDate = X, EndDate = Y

                          does not unify with the ternary interval[X,Y,Z]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
In Prolog a positional rest variable -- only permitted in lists -- is indicated by
separating it from previous elements via a "|" instead of the normal "," separator.
Here, a positional rest variable -- permitted in lists, structures, atoms, etc. --
is again indicated by a "|" instead of the normal "," separator; we
will also allow a "!" instead of the normal ";" separator for
unordered ('object-oriented') complex terms.
</p>

<p>
With such explicit rest variables,
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">interval[StartDate,EndDate|ResumeDates] unifies with variable X
                          by binding X = interval[StartDate,EndDate|ResumeDates]

                          does not unify with the unary interval[X]

                          unifies with the binary interval[X,Y]
                          by binding StartDate = X, EndDate = Y, ResumeDates = []

                          unifies with the ternary interval[X,Y,Z]
                          by binding StartDate = X, EndDate = Y, ResumeDates = [Z]

                          unifies with the 4-ary interval[X,Y,Z,"2004"]
                          by binding StartDate = X, EndDate = Y, ResumeDates = [Z,"2004"]

                          unifies with the (1+n)-ary interval[X|Y]
                          by binding StartDate = X, Y = [EndDate|ResumeDates]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Dereferencing is performed at least during unification, before built-ins are called, and for result printouts
(the issue of performing or not performing the 'occurs check' is orthogonal to this
discussion).
</p>

<p>
The object-oriented interval[start->A;end->B] does not unify with the positional
interval[A,B]. However, an operation positionalize(interval[start->A;end->B]) can
be defined to return the ordered interval[B,A] by omitting the role names after a
lexicographic normalization (sorting) w.r.t. the role names. This interval[B,A] in
turn would unify with the positional interval[A,B] by binding B = A.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, interval[start->X;end->B] does not unify with interval[A,B]
</p>

<p>
Neither do interval[start->a;end->b] and interval[X,b] unify, where
the lower-case letters 'a' and 'b' are individual constants.
Instantiation for positional cterms is defined as usual; for object-oriented cterms
it is defined to apply the bindings of a substitution to the fJ of each slot rj->fJ
(cf. remarks below on forbidding variables in the position of roles rJ).
</p>

<p>
f[a->A] does not unify with f[a->A;b->B], since rest variables must be explicit
also for object-oriented cterms.
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">With the '!'-separator introduced above, f[a->A!X] unifies with f[a->A;b->B]
                                         by binding X = [b->B].

Similarly,                               f[a->A!X] unifies with f[a->A;b->B;c->C]
                                         by binding X = [b->B;c->C].</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Here, an existential is made explicit after the '!'-separator by a fresh variable X
(so the collection of these rest roles can be referred to via X).
Alternatively, an 'anonymous' variable can be employed (as in Prolog written as '_'):
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">f[a->A!_] unifies with f[a->A;b->B]        without any bindings
f[a->A!_] unifies with f[a->A;b->B;c->C]   without any bindings</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Applications for case and feature grammars, frame and description logics, RDF and OWL, etc. can thus be done
equally well, and the more precise '!'-free OO cterms can enforce more restricted
unifications where needed.
</p>

<p>
In general, keeping unification deterministic,
the arguments of an atom or cterm may contain a single ('|'-separated) rest variable
for their positional part plus a single ('!'-separated) rest variable for their rolled part.
</p>

<p>
For example, generalizing a query in the Introduction,
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount("Peter Miller","Honda",Amount | Resequence;
         period->When;region->Where ! Reslots)</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
(deterministically) unifies with
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount("Peter Miller","Honda","5.0 percent","Auto Deals","full warranty";

</p>

<p>
Inluding both kinds of rest variables, the most general kind of OO atoms/cterms are 'left-and-right-rolled' cterms
of the (left-"!"-variable) forms
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">p(r1->f1;...;rL->fL!Vf;e1,...,eM|Ve;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN)
c[r1->f1;...;rL->fL!Vf;e1,...,eM|Ve;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
or, equivalently, of the (right-"!"-variable) forms
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">p(r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM|Ve;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN!Vf)
c[r1->f1;...;rL->fL;e1,...,eM|Ve;rL+1->fL+1;...;rN->fN!Vf]</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Variables are not permitted <em>as</em> roles for several reasons, two of which being:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/1366.html">functionality</a>
of OO cterms could be lost, since initially different variables in two role
positions could become unified when additionally used in a filler position.
<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">For example, f[X->1;Y->2;c->g[X,Y]] would unify with f[U->1;V->2;c->g[Z,Z]]
with non-functional common instance f[Z->1;Z->2;c->g[Z,Z]].</span></pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>There would no longer be a unique most general unifier, so non-determinism
would already arise during the unification phase of resolution.
<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">For example, f[X->U;Y->V] would unify with f[a->1;b->2]
by binding X = a, U = 1, Y = b, V = 2 or, equally general,
by binding X = b, U = 2, Y = a, V = 1.</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="section_4" name="section_4">4. Webizing</a></h2>

<p>
The PR language elements of individuals, constructors, and relations can be
<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Webize.html">webized</a> by giving them URIs.
It is important to notice that different occurrences of the same language element can
thus be disambiguated by giving them different URIs.
</p>

<p>
Also, we distinguish two kinds of URIs in the PR knowledge-representation language:
An active URI meant to be dereferenced (the usual case) is enclosed in a pair of single quotes;
a passive URI meant to stand for itself (the unusual case) is enclosed in a pair of double quotes
</p>

Syntactically, then, a language element occurrence is associated with an active URI
using a "+>" infix. The "+>" operator glues together webized elements with maximum
precedence, followed by the infix operators ":" (see Typing section) and "->" (see Introduction).
</p>

<p>
For example, the individual symbol "Peter Miller" can be associated with a URI
for the intended Peter Miller's homepage 'http://www.peter_miller.org' to obtain
the following webized individual:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">"Peter Miller"+>'http://www.peter_miller.org'</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
The unary positional fact
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium("Peter Miller").</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
can now be webized using the above webized individual as the single argument as follows:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium("Peter Miller"+>'http://www.peter_miller.org').</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, the unary rolled fact
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium(cust->"Peter Miller").</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
can be webized using the webized individual as the filler of the single argument role as follows:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium(cust->"Peter Miller"+>'http://www.peter_miller.org').</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
The special case of an active URI not associated with any named language element is
captured by just employing this URI in place of the language element.
</p>

<p>
For example, Peter Miller's homepage can be directly
used as an active URI in the positional or rolled facts, thus:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium('http://www.peter_miller.org').</span></pre>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium(cust->'http://www.peter_miller.org').</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Contrast this with facts over the corresponding passive URI,
stating a property of the URI string itself:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">underscored("http://www.peter_miller.org").</span></pre>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">underscored(strng->"http://www.peter_miller.org").</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
Besides associating a language element with an active URI and
employing an active URI in place of a language element, the third possibility is
just using the original language element as we did before webizing.
The PR language thus supports a mix of all three options, so users
can tune their degree of webizing.
</p>

<p>
Let us proceed to webizing another language element, relations,
employing active URIs in place of that language element.
</p>

<p>
As an example consider two well-known RDF descriptions:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">&lt;rdf:RDF>
  &lt;rdf:Description about="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">
    &lt;s:Creator rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/staffId/85740"/>
  &lt;/rdf:Description>
  &lt;rdf:Description about="http://www.w3.org/staffId/85740">
    &lt;v:Name>Ora Lassila&lt;/v:Name>
    &lt;v:Email>lassila@w3.org&lt;/v:Email>
  &lt;/rdf:Description>
&lt;/rdf:RDF>
</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
One PR version of these descriptions leads to two rolled facts,
where the RDF subjects map to relations that are active URIs
(we permit namespace prefixes for PR role names):
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">'http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila'(s:Creator->'http://www.w3.org/staffId/85740').
'http://www.w3.org/staffId/85740'(v:Name->"Ora Lassila";v:Email->"lassila@w3.org").</span></pre>
</div>


<div class="div5">
<h2><a id="section_5" name="section_5">5. Typing</a></h2>

<p>
Up to this point, only untyped individuals and variables were used.
Here we proceed to an optional PR type extension expressed via
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/qnameids-2002-04-30">QNames</a> that URI-reference
RDF or OWL classes. Since it concerns individuals and variables wherever they occur,
PR typing is orthogonal to the 'positional/rolled' distinction.
</p>

<p>
Basically, individuals such as "Peter Miller" and variables such as Customer
can be typed by prefixing them with a URI referencing their RDF or OWL member class,
say 'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass'. As in XML namespaces, this
is performed with a colon separator between the typing namespace and the local name,
which is an individual or a variable. In our case, we obtain QNames (Qualified Names)
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':"Peter Miller"</span></pre>
</div>

or

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':Customer</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
The variables Customer and Product of our introductory Prolog-like discount example
can be typed by prefixing each occurrence with such a URI reference:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount('http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':Customer,
         'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass':Product,
         "5.0 percent")  :-       
   premium('http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':Customer),
   regular('http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass':Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
However, for such re-occurring URIs we can use
'constant declarations' similar to XML namespace and N3 prefix declarations.
For this we just use an ":=" infix,
here declaring local names c and p for the Customer and Product types, respectively. These
'shortcuts' are then employed, macro-like, instead of the full URIs:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">c:='http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass'.
p:='http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass'.

discount(c:Customer,p:Product,"5.0 percent")  :-       
   premium(c:Customer), regular(p:Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
The direct typing use of URIs is also possible for our F-logic-like discount example:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">discount(cust->'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':Customer;
         prod->'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass':Product;
         rebate->"5.0 percent") :-
   premium(cust->'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':Customer),
   regular(prod->'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass':Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
But again 'URI declarations' are preferable here:
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">c:='http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass'.
p:='http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Prodclass'.

discount(cust->c:Customer;prod->p:Product;rebate->"5.0 percent") :-
   premium(cust->c:Customer), regular(prod->p:Product).</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
For some PR formulas it will be advantageous to type certain individuals/variables directly
-- e.g., single-occurrence variables -- and other ones via URI declarations.
These typing possibilities are also available for all kinds of PR formulas,
including combined positional/rolled formulas, facts, and queries.
</p>




<p>
Typing can be combined with webizing as shown by the following example
(the webizing "+>" has highest precedence, followed by the typing ":" and the rolling "->"):
</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre><span style="font-family: courier; font-size: 10pt">premium(cust->'http://e-biz.org/taxonomy#Custclass':"Peter Miller"+>'http://www.peter_miller.org').</span></pre>
</div>




<p>
Type checking for individuals can be performed statically;
for variables, it must normally be deferred to run-time.
For RDF Schema and OWL Light class hierarchies, greatest-lower-bound techniques from
order-sorted logics can be used for computing type intersections.
In combination with OWL DL and OWL Full, techniques from description logic classifiers
will become necessary.

<h2><a id="section_6" name="section_6">6. Implementation</a></h2>

<p>Marcel Ball has implemented a Java-based parser and generator to translate between the
PR syntax and OO RuleML.

<ul>
  <li>The parser servlet is available online at <a href="http://198.164.40.138:8080/conv-20030715/servlet/AsciiToRuleML">http://198.164.40.138:8080/conv-20030715/servlet/AsciiToRuleML</a>.
</li>

<li>The generator servlet is available online at <a href="http://198.164.40.138:8080/conv-20030715/servlet/RuleMLtoAscii">http://198.164.40.138:8080/conv-20030715/servlet/RuleMLtoAscii</a>.
</li>
</ul>

It will probably be easy to write such a parser in any other language as well.
</p>

<p>To go -- in both directions -- between positional and rolled forms, Stephen Greene
has XSLT-implemented 'signature' declarations for preserving order and role information,
which could also be extended to type and mode information; the
development URL is <a href="http://198.164.40.138/ruleml/ooruleml-xslt/">http://198.164.40.138/ruleml/ooruleml-xslt/</a>, and a URI will later
be reachable again via <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/indoo">http://www.ruleml.org/indoo</a>. The ideas of 'positionalizing'
are based on earlier work Michael Sintek and I did at DFKI.</p>

<p>While the rule shorthand syntax is expected to stay as
a plain text (ASCII) syntax for convenient input and parsing (into OO RuleML),
the presentation syntax will be able to exploit, with XSLT,
the possibilities of XHTML (such as font and color
to differentiate individuals, variables, relations, etc.).
An early version of such a generator was XSLT-implemented for <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/~boley/ruleml-mht.pdf">RFML rules</a>.
Further possibilities arise Unicode and graphics (such as merging the
two-character symbols ":-", "->", and "+>" into single characters,
e.g. into a single-character two-shafted backarrow, a normal arrow,
and a special 'hyperlink' symbol, respectively).

<h2><a id="section_7" name="section_7">7. Issues</a></h2>

<p>
A solution for the following issue has been found:

<ol>
<li>Positional rest variables are separated from previous terms by a "|",
as in Prolog (rather than using ",,").
Rolled rest variables are separated from previous terms by a "!"
(rather than using ";;"). Putting this information into the separator,
rather than into the variable name, simplifies ensuring that there is
at most one positional and one rolled rest variable on each level of a cterm
or an atom; it also enables function expressions (see below) that are 'rest-valued'.
</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
Ongoing work includes looking into the following issues,
along with possible semantic ramifications:

<ol>
<li>Variables are currently distinguished from individuals using Prolog's first-letter-capitalizing
convention. This can be easily augmented or replaced by Prolog's first-character-underscore convention. Other first-character conventions such as
SCL's question mark are being considered as well.
</li>

<li>Active URIs are currently enclosed in single quotes.
Other conventions such as N3's angular brackets are also being considered.
</li>

<li>Of the two-character symbols, ":-" has already been widely used for
backward implications (even though "<-" has also been used instead),
"->" has often been used for role-filler slots (but it has also
been used for forward implications, not employed in PR), and "+>" has apparently
not been used yet for webizing (and other options for the -- asymmetric -- association
of language elements with URIs are also being evaluated).
</li>

<li>For describing objects -- e.g., for RDF's 'about' descriptions --
active URIs are currently being employed in place of relations.
Alternative ways of object description include <em>assigning</em> a rolled struct
to an (active URI) object, <em>applying</em> the struct to it, etc.
It remains to be worked out which option will be the semantically preferred one.
</li>

<li>A distinguished symmetric equality predicate could be easily introduced as an "=" infix (also see the next issue on the directed equality of function definitions).
</li>

<li>Only derivation rules are currently captured.
Functions and their defining transformation rules will be easy.
It should also be possible to incorporate certain kinds of reaction rules.
</li>

<li>Access to order-sorted types is currently being supported.
The development of further extensions towards OWL DL and OWL Full should be doable.
</li>
<li>No <em>relevance</em> differentiations are currently performed for the roles within a given cterm
or atom.
The weighted extension of OO RuleML could be transferred to permitting optional role weights in the PR syntax.
</li>
</ol>
