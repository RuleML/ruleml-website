<h2><a id="section-abstract" name="section-abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>This document describes the effort undertaken jointly by the RuleML Initiative
and the Joint United States / European Union ad hoc Agent Markup Language Committee to deliver a specification of a Semantic Web Rule
Language. One of our goals is to complement the OWL ontology language. RuleML has already defined a markup
language for publishing and sharing rule bases on the World Wide Web.
RuleML builds a hierarchy of rule sublanguages upon XML, RDF, XSLT, and OWL.
The syntax work should take into consideration both the human needs
and the interchange requirements.</p>

<p>
This document will serve as the starting point for the various sections defined in previous
working sessions, e.g. Requirements and Use Cases, Syntax, Semantics and Examples illustrating
key language features.

<h2><a id="section_1" name="section_1">1. Introduction, Background and Motivation</a></h2>

<h3><a id="section_1_1" name="section_1_1">1.1 The Need for Rules on the
Web</a></h3>

<p>Rules have traditionally been used in theoretical computer science,
compiler technology, databases, logic programming, and Artificial
Intelligence. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">The Semantic Web</a> tries
to represent information in the World Wide Web such that it can be used by
machines not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration,
sharing and reuse across applications. Rule Markup for the Semantic Web has
been a hot topic since rules were identified as one of its <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html">design issues</a>.</p>

<p>However, Semantic Web rules have been less systematically studied than the
corresponding ontology (actually, taxonomy) markup. The Rule Markup
Initiative tries to fill the gap by exploring rule systems (e.g., extended
Horn logics) suitable for the Web, their (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>) syntax, semantics,
tractability/efficiency, and transformation and compilation. Both derivation
rules (which may be evaluated bottom-up as in deductive databases, top-down
as in logic programming, or by tabled resolution as in <a
href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/">XSB</a>) and reaction rules (also called
"ECA" - "Event-Condition-Action" -- or "trigger" rules), as well as possible
combinations, are being considered.</p>

<h3><a id="section_1_2" name="section_1_2">1.2 The Rule Markup
Initiative</a></h3>

<p>The RuleML Initiative started in August 2000 during the Pacific Rim
International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (<a
href="http://www3.cm.deakin.edu.au/pricai/frames/main.html">PRICAI 2000</a>).
It has brought together expert teams from several countries, including
leaders in Knowledge Representation and Markup Languages, from both academia
and industry. </p>

<p>Among our industrial participants are rules engine vendors, Web technology
vendors, XML/RDF tools vendors and also technology users such as financial
corporations, telecom companies and some of the major Web portals and ASPs.
The RuleML Initiative is collaborating with numerous related efforts such as
the complementary Java Rules Engine API specification, the W3C RDF working
group, the DAML group, W3C P3P Activity, PMML, and many others. This
collaboration will enable RuleML to share mechanisms and provide a rules
language to existing and emerging industry standards such as the Semantic Web
and RDF, P3P, CC/PP and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange).</p>

<h3><a id="section_1_3" name="section_1_3">1.3 Rules in the Semantic Web and Web Services</a></h3>

<p>In the context of the Semantic Web, rules may be built on F-logic for <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> inference, as pioneered by <a
href="http://ontobroker.semanticweb.org/silri/">SiLRI</a>. This work has
recently been extended for rules with expressive bodies (full FOL syntax) in
<a href="http://triple.semanticweb.org/">TRIPLE</a>. Rules may also be used
to enhance the content of Web pages and XML documents in various ways. E.g.,
derivation rules allow the dynamic inclusion of derived facts, while reaction
rules allow the specification of behavior in response to browser events.</p>

<h2><a id="section_2" name="section_2">2. Requirements and Use Cases</a></h2>

<p>
The requirements and use cases is a link to the work done by Stefan Decker and Mike Dean and other JC members. Details on earlier presentations can be found in the <a href="http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/1388.html">archives</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="section_3" name="section_3">3. Presentation Syntax</a></h2>

<p>The Rule Shorthand and Presentation Syntax is described <a href="ruleml-shortation.html">here.</a></p>

<p></p>
<h3><a id="section_4" name="section_4">4. XML Markup</a></h3>

<p>We give a high level overview of the markup with examples from the discount use case.
The XML markup is a step forward to provide a more 'human' friendly
RuleML syntax based on input from various members and participants. As a result,
the proposed syntax will allow for a shortened rules markup and an easier to use syntax.
</p>



<p>The following first example is the RuleML discount datalog example re-implemented in the simplified markup:

</p>
<p>A more detailed list of examples is presented <a href="essentialruleml.html">here.</a></p>
<p></p>


<h2><a id="section_5" name="section_5">5. Language Semantics</a></h2>

<p></p>
<p>
Initial discussions on semantics can be summarized by the notes sent by Benjamin Grosof from the <a href="http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/1388.html">June 24th, 2003 JC telecon</a>.
