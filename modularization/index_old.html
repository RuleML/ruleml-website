<h2><a name="Motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
        
        <p>Specifying RuleML with XML Schema has proven to be problematic, beginning with the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/inxsd0.8.html#Issues">first attempt in 0.8</a> and then
            with the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/xsd/0.85/">more complete
                representation in 0.85</a>. While many issues have been resolved, the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/#Re-Modularization">re-modularization of the
                sublanguage hierarchy in 0.85</a> revealed an inconsistency in XML Schema: using
            xs:redefine, it is straight-forward to extend a particle's occurrence range
            by increasing the upperbound (i.e. the value of the maxOccurs attribute), but not when
            it comes to decreasing the lowerbound (i.e. the value of the minOccurs attribute). The
            issue has been raised twice (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2004Jan/0004.html">1</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2004May/0001.html">2</a>) on the
                <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/">W3C XML Schema
                developers list</a> (xmlschema-dev@w3.org) but is still outstanding.</p>
        <p>Particular to RuleML, this &quot;expressiveness gap&quot; in XML Schema does not permit extending a
            binary atom (e.g. in bindatalog) to have an unbounded number of terms (e.g. in datalog).
            This means that the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/Inheritance_diagram.gif">modularization
                introduced in RuleML 0.85</a> with urcbindatagroundfact as the ultimate root cannot
            (easily) be implemented using XML Schema.</p>
    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
        
        <p>Related elements and/or attributes of RuleML have been grouped into static modules which are
           often referred to in this discussion.  These modules contain element and/or attribute definitions
           and are not intended to be used directly for validation. They may, however, be used to create
           new document types by others wishing to &quot;borrow&quot; certain elements of RuleML much like XHTML.
         </p>
         <p>The modules and their contents as of RuleML 0.87 are as follows (where attributes are prefixed with &quot;@&quot;):
            <ul>
               <li>
<b>toplevel</b> - Rulebase, @direction, clause, Fact, Imp, Query</li>
               <li>
<b>clause</b> - head, body</li>
               <li>
<b>desc</b> - rbaselab, rlab</li>
               <li>
<b>atom</b> - Atom, opr, Rel</li>
               <li>
<b>boole</b> - And, Or, wff</li>
               <li>
<b>role</b> - role, Slot, @card, @weight, name, filler</li>
               <li>
<b>term</b> - arg, @index, Ind, Var, @type</li>
               <li>
<b>ur</b> - @href</li>                  
               <li>
<b>cterm</b> - Cterm, opc, Ctor, Plex</li>
               <li>
<b>equality</b> - Eq, side, Nano, opf, Fun</li>
               <li>
<b>negation</b> - Neg, strong, Naf, weak</li> 
               </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Also note that the schemas developed as part of this evaluation are not necessarily
            complete and do not represent actual releases of RuleML. They are experimental in nature
            and are only included here for illustrative purposes.</p>
    <h2><a name="Version 1: &quot;Bus&quot;">Version 1: &quot;Bus&quot;</a></h2>
      
      <p>Numerous approaches to working around the encountered <a href="#Motivation">XML Schema problem</a>
      have been attempted, but none were found to be satisfactory when implemented
      (i.e. according to popular validators, W3C's
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XML Schema Validator</a> aka XSV in particular).
      This first of the three alternative versions of RuleML modularization involves a novel
      approach, but <a href="bus/">its implementation</a>
      still involves a workaround which causes problems for XSV in some cases.</p>
      <p>The basis of this approach is the separation of the actual schema driver from an &quot;auxiliary&quot;
      container module for each sublanguage.  The auxiliary modules inherit from one another while the
      drivers are not directly related, except through the auxiliary modules which they include.
      For example, the datalog sublanguage is specified in the driver
      <a href="bus/datalog.xsd">datalog.xsd</a>, which includes auxiliary module
      <a href="bus/aux_datalog.xsd">aux_datalog.xsd</a>.  Because of the XML Schema limitation,
      the 'atom' module must be handled as a special case and be independent of the auxiliary
      modules, instead being included or redefined by each driver as needed.  In this way, the atom module
      does not have to begin as being binary, so no problems arise as a result of trying to
      decrease its lower bound.  The following diagram may clarify:</p>
<b><pre>     ...                          atom
      |                             |
aux_bindatalog -- [bindatalog] -----|
      |                             |
 aux_datalog ----- [datalog] -------|
      |                             |
aux_urdatalog --- [urdatalog] ------|
      |                             |
     ...                           ...</pre></b>
      <p>The similarity between this representation and a bus architecture diagram should be quite clear,
      hence the mnemonic of &quot;bus&quot; for this version.</p>
                
       <p>When attempting to validate hornlog.xsd, urhornlog.xsd, equalog.xsd or urequalog.xsd with XSV, the following message appears
       in addition to the usual results of successful validation:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white"><tr><td>
<b>Schema validator crashed</b><br>
The maintainers of XSV will be notified, you don't need to send mail about this unless you have extra information to provide.
If there are Schema errors reported below, try correcting them and re-running the validation.
</td></tr></table>
        <p>Other validators such as XMLSpy and Saxon respond much better, but this error nonetheless
           casts doubt on the validity of these schemas. Because there are better alternatives to this approach,
           however, we will not pursue the matter further.</p>
    <h2><a name="Version 2: &quot;Star&quot;">Version 2: &quot;Star&quot;</a></h2>
        
            <p>This second approach is largely monolithic in the sense that the driver for each sublanguage is
               entirely independent of other sublanguage drivers (except for urdatalog, urhornlog, urequalog
               and negation sublanguages). Thus each driver includes (and/or redefines, as the case may be)
               from various modules, e.g. <a href="star/bindatalog.xsd">bindatalog.xsd</a>:</p>

   <b><pre>  ...
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/core_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/desc_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/clause_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/boole_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;modules/atom_module.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- restrict atoms to binary --&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom.extend&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;	
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;
  &lt;/xs:redefine&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/role_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/term_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;	
  
  ...</pre></b>

<p>This might be visualized as follows, revealing the reason behind this approach being labeled &quot;star&quot;:</p>
<b><pre>
          atom    boole    term
             \      |       /
              \     |      /
       core -- [bindatalog] 
              /     |      \    
             /      |       \    
           role   clause   desc  
</pre></b>
      <p>The <a href="star/">implementation</a> of this version of modularization is quite straightforward
      and validates fine in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XSV</a>; the monolithic quality
      of the schemas avoids the <a href="#Motivation">aforementioned problem</a> altogether. However, it
      deviates from previous versions of RuleML by involving very little inheritance, making sublanguage
      relationships (and expressivity) unclear.  Another downside is that there is a lot of redundancy among
      the sublanguage drivers with modules being included separately in each.</p>
      <p>This approach is basically the same as that used for the 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml-modularization-20040218/">modularization of XHTML</a>,
      but it seems much better suited for such scenarios where only a few sublanguages are involved. It is
      far from ideal for RuleML.
      </p>
    <h2><a name="Version 3: &quot;Tree&quot;">Version 3: &quot;Tree&quot;</a></h2>
        
        <p>The final approach considered here is similar to a
           <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld012.htm">previous modularization</a> though
           oriented slightly differently and now involving 
           <a href="#Introduction">elementary modules</a>. It might be visualized as follows,
           a tree centered around the datalog sublanguage:</p>
<b><pre>
                    core
                      |
                atom  | desc
                   |  |  | 
             role  |  |  |   term
                 \ |  |  | / 
         boole -- [datalog] -- clause
                 *    *    *
              *       *       *    
           *          *          *          
     [urdatalog] [bindatalog] [hornlog]
          *     \              *     *
          *      \           *         *          
    [urcdatalog]  \     [urhornlog] [equalog]
          *        \    /               *    
          *         \  /                *              
   [urcbindatalog]   ur ---------- [urequalog]
          *
          *          
 [urcbindatagroundlog]
          *
          *         
[urcbindatagroundfact]
</pre></b>
       <p>Clearly this version of modularization involves much more direct inheritance (indicated
          by &quot;*&quot;) than the other versions so far considered. Its <a href="tree/">implementation</a>
          avoids the <a href="#Motivation">XSD-technical problem</a> and is consistent with previous
          RuleML specifications wherein sublanguage relationships are
          explicitly indicated by taking advantage of inheritance.  For example, bindatalog
          is fundamentally the same as datalog except with binary atoms, so
          <a href="tree/bindatalog.xsd">bindatalog.xsd</a> need only slightly 
          redefine <a href="tree/datalog.xsd">datalog.xsd</a>:
       </p>

<b><pre>  ...

  &lt;!-- bindatalog redefines datalog so that atoms are binary --&gt;
  &lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom.extend&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;		
  &lt;/xs:redefine&gt;
  
  ...</pre></b>
       <p>Thus, the XSDs implementing this approach not only capture sublanguage expressiveness,
          but manage to do it in a compact and efficient way.

	<p>Consistent with object-oriented modelling conventions, the most
            expressive &quot;class&quot; (i.e. sublanguage) is shown at the top and generality decreases in top-down

            indicates an aggregation association (e.g. &quot;datalog is <i>part of</i> hornlog&quot; and
            &quot;cterm is <i>part of</i> hornlog&quot;) while regular-headed arrows indicate generalization
            or inheritance (e.g. &quot;bindatalog <i>is a</i> datalog&quot;). Note that certain aggregation associations,
	such as hornlog to nafhornlog and hornlogeq, branch and have two targets.  This new notation logically places all
	target nodes on the same (horizontal) level.
	</p>
	<p>The ovals in this model represent elementary modules which act as &quot;private&quot;
            constituents of the actual sublanguages (which are represented as rectangles). This composition
            may happen directly, as is most obvious for datalog, or indirectly through subsequent
            associations.  For example, the model shows that bindatalog is not directly associated with any modules, 
            but it inherits them (with some modification) when it derives from datalog. According
            to these conventions, ovals cannot be associated with one another because they are
            dependent on rectangles. A dashed line indicates this dependency, as distinct from
            the standard aggregation relationship shown with a solid line.
	</p>
        <p>The model conveys meaning on the &quot;implementation&quot; (i.e. XML Schema specification) level as well.  In XSD, ovals become
            non-standalone modules containing element and/or attribute definitions, and are not intended to be
            used directly for validation.  They may, however, be used to create new document types by users
            wishing to &quot;borrow&quot; certain elements of RuleML 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/introduction.html#s_intro_xhtml_mods">much like in XHTML</a>.
            Rectangles, on the other hand, are schema drivers composed in whole or in part of these modules or
            derived entirely from other schema drivers.
	</p>
	<p>The association lines in this model also reveal schema
            dependencies within the &quot;implementation&quot;.  In XML Schema, connected rectangles are joined using
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#modify-schema">xs:redefine</a>,
            whereas ovals are connected to rectangles using
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#compound-schema">xs:include</a>.  Elementary modules are generally
            included &quot;as is&quot;, but sublanguages connected with xs:redefine either extend or restrict one another.  In XML Schema,
            extension via redefine is distinguished from restriction by whether or not there is a self-reference 
            (see <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2002Oct/0113.html">this explanation</a>).  In other words,
            if there is no self-reference, the containing schema is deriving from a parent; otherwise, there is a self-reference and the
            schema is generalizing from a child.
	</p>
          <p>For example, consider the following section of hornlog.xsd:</p>
<b><pre>&lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
            &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xs:group ref=&quot;atom&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;cterm&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;plex&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;	
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;
&lt;/xs:redefine&gt;</pre></b>
            <p>The group self-reference in this XML Schema excerpt identifies hornlog as being an extension of datalog.  On the other hand, 
            the absence of a self-reference, as in the section of bindatalog.xsd below, indicates a restriction:</p>
            
            
<b><pre>&lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
            &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;		
&lt;/xs:redefine&gt;</pre></b>
            
<p>Currently all sublanguages contain mixtures of positional and slotted terms: a design decision was made to &quot;mix in&quot; optional slots in all existing sublanguages instead of creating all new sublanguages differing only by this one feature.  With the frame module in 0.89, purely slotted Atoms (called frames) are introduced.  Likewise, a purely positional sublanguage (c.f. prolog) is also possible.</p>
