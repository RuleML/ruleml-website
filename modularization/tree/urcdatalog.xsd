	<!--
		atom element uses an _opr  role followed by an ind with a REQUIRED href attribute
		followed by an ind with IMPLIED href attribute, or equivalently, with _opr at the end
		This 'local' REQUIRED-vs.-IMPLIED constraint was not possible with DTDs and has yet
		to be implemented in the XSDs, so urcdatalog is currently equivalent to urcdatalog
