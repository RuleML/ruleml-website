       <p> RuleML is a <b>family</b> of sublanguages whose <b>root</b> allows access to the language as a whole and whose <b>members</b> allow to identify
customized subsets of the language. Therefore, RuleML's specification employs <i>modular</i> XML Schemas as
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/">pioneered by XHTML</a>.  Following the general software engineering principle of modularity leads to
	increased maintainability (taking advantage of inheritance) and interoperability, accommodating rule subcommunities who are able to specify whichever
	sublanguage in the family (each corresponding to an expressive class, e.g. Datalog and Hornlog) best suits their needs.

	<p>Consistent with object-oriented modelling conventions, the most
            expressive &quot;class&quot; (i.e. sublanguage) is shown at the top and generality decreases in top-down
            order. As in the the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a diamond-headed arrow
            indicates an aggregation association (e.g. &quot;datalog is <i>part of</i> hornlog&quot; and
            &quot;cterm is <i>part of</i> hornlog&quot;) while regular-headed arrows indicate generalization
            as used for inheritance (e.g. &quot;bindatalog <i>is a</i> datalog&quot;). Note that certain aggregation associations,
	such as hornlog to nafhornlog and hornlogeq, branch and have multiple (here, two) targets.  This new notation logically places all
	target nodes on the same (horizontal) level.
	</p>
	<p>The ovals in this model represent elementary modules which act as &quot;private&quot;
            constituents of the actual sublanguages (which are represented as rectangles). This composition
            may happen directly, as is most obvious for datalog, or indirectly through subsequent
            associations.  For example, the model shows that bindatalog is not directly associated with any modules, 
            but it inherits them (with some modification) when it derives from datalog. According
            to these conventions, ovals cannot be associated with one another because they are
            dependent on rectangles. A dashed line indicates this dependency, as distinct from
            the standard aggregation relationship shown with a solid line.
	</p>
        <p>The model conveys meaning on the &quot;implementation&quot; (i.e. XML Schema specification) level as well.  In XSD, ovals become
            non-standalone modules containing element and/or attribute definitions, and are not intended to be
            used directly for validation.  They may, however, be used to create new document types by users
            wishing to &quot;borrow&quot; certain elements of RuleML 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/introduction.html#s_intro_xhtml_mods">much like in XHTML</a>.
            Rectangles, on the other hand, are schema drivers composed in whole or in part of these modules or
            derived entirely from other schema drivers.
	</p>
	<p>The association lines in this model also reveal schema
            dependencies within the &quot;implementation&quot;.  In XML Schema, connected rectangles are joined using
            <code>&lt;redefine&gt;</code>,
            whereas ovals are connected to rectangles using
            <code>&lt;include&gt;</code>.  Elementary modules are generally
            included &quot;as is&quot;, but sublanguages connected with <code>&lt;redefine&gt;</code> either extend or restrict one another.  In XML Schema,
            extension via <code>&lt;redefine&gt;</code> is distinguished from restriction by whether or not there is a self-reference 
            (see <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2002Oct/0113.html">this explanation</a>).  In other words,
            if there is no self-reference, the containing schema is deriving from a parent; otherwise, there is a self-reference and the
            schema is generalizing from a child.
	</p>
          <p>For example, consider the following section of hornlog.xsd:</p>
<b><pre>&lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:group name=&quot;arg.content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;xs:group ref=&quot;arg.content&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;Expr&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Plex&quot; type=&quot;Plex.type&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
  &lt;/xs:group&gt;
&lt;/xs:redefine&gt;  
</pre></b>
            <p>The group self-reference in this XML Schema excerpt identifies hornlog as being an extension of datalog.  On the other hand, 
            the absence of a self-reference, as in the section of bindatalog.xsd below, indicates a restriction:</p>
            
<b><pre>&lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:group name=&quot;Atom.extend&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;arg&quot;/&gt;					
        &lt;xs:group ref=&quot;arg.content&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
    &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;		
  &lt;/xs:group&gt;
&lt;/xs:redefine&gt;</pre></b>
            
<p>Most sublanguages contain mixtures of positional and slotted terms: a design decision was made to allow optional slots in all existing sublanguages instead of duplicating all sublanguages with &quot;near copies&quot; differing only by this one feature.  With the frame module since 0.89, purely slotted Atoms (called frames) are introduced.  Likewise, a purely positional sublanguage (cf. logic) is also possible.</p>

<a name="pr"><h3>PR RuleML</h3></a>
      <p>Production (PR) RuleML is currently under development.</p>
            
    <h2><a name="Approach">Approach</a></h2>
		
		<p>The modularization of RuleML uses a content-model based approach. The approach is demonstrated graphically (with animation)
		for the 0.85 DTDs on slide 25 of the
		<a href="../0.85/ooruleml-remodularized_schematized.ppt">Object-Oriented RuleML: Re-Modularized and XML Schematized via Content Models</a>
		presentation, where
		rectangles represent element declarations and circles represent their content models. Below, the approach is explained in terms of DTDs and then for XML Schema.</p>
		
		<p>DTDs have limited support for modularity, but it can be achieved in a roundabout
		   way using macro-like parameter entities. In particular, the contents of an external
		   file can be included using an externally-linked parameter entity. For example, the
		   following includes the contents of <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/dtd/datalog.dtd">datalog.dtd</a>:</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>
&lt;!ENTITY % datalog_include SYSTEM &quot;datalog.dtd&quot;&gt;
%datalog_include;
</pre></b>
		</p>
		
		<p>Simple inclusion is not enough, though: overriding is also necessary. Previously,
		   this was managed using INCLUDE/IGNORE sections: the section that declared the element
		   which had to be changed was simply IGNOREd, then the element was re-declared.</p>
		
		<p>In version 0.85, this clumsy method of overriding was replaced with a much more elegent solution
		wherein every element's content model was explicitly defined by a parameter entity. The old rulebase label
		   <code>&lt;_rbaselab&gt;</code>, for example, became declared as follows:</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;!ENTITY % _rbaselab.content &quot;(ind)&quot;&gt; 
&lt;!ELEMENT _rbaselab %_rbaselab.content;&gt;
</pre></b>

		</p>
		<p>Since parameter entities can overwrite one another (even across files), this
		   content model could be easily replaced with another specified in a different DTD altogether,
		   much like re-assigning a global variable in traditional programming languages. For example,
		   the content model of the rulebase label <code>&lt;_rbaselab&gt;</code> is just <code>(ind)</code> in
		   <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/dtd/urcbindatagroundfact.dtd">urcbindatagroundfact.dtd</a>
		   (as above), but was extended to permit a complex term (thus, becoming <code>(ind | cterm)</code>) in
		   <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/dtd/hornlog.dtd">hornlog.dtd</a>:</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;!ENTITY % _rbaselab.content &quot;(ind | cterm)&quot;&gt;</pre></b>
		</p>
		<p>(Note that this overriding entity must be defined before the inclusion of other files.)</p>
		<p>The content model-based approach to modularization also works for XML Schema, using groups
		   (and attributeGroups) instead of parameter entities. For example (now using 0.88+ syntax, where <code>&lt;_rbaselab&gt;</code>
		   is now <code>&lt;oid&gt;</code>),</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;!ENTITY % oid.content &quot;(ind)&quot;&gt; 
&lt;!ELEMENT oid % oid.content;&gt;
</pre></b>
		</p>
		<p>becomes</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;xs:attributeGroup name=&quot;oid.attlist&quot;/&gt;
&lt;xs:group name=&quot;oid.content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:choice&gt;
    &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Ind&quot; type=&quot;Ind-oid.type&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
&lt;/xs:group&gt;
&lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;oid.type&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:group ref=&quot;oid.content&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xs:attributeGroup ref=&quot;oid.attlist&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
&lt;xs:element name=&quot;oid&quot; type=&quot;oid.type&quot;/&gt;
</pre></b>
		</p>
		<p>There is no need for workarounds in XSD: <code>&lt;redefine&gt;</code> makes the specified
		changes and includes everything else.  For example,</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;!ENTITY % oid.content &quot;(ind | cterm)&quot;&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY % include SYSTEM &quot;datalog.dtd&quot;&gt;
%include;
</pre></b>
		</p>
		<p>becomes</p>
		<p>
<b><pre>&lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:group name=&quot;oid.content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;xs:group ref=&quot;oid.content&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;Cterm&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
  &lt;/xs:group&gt;
&lt;/xs:redefine&gt;
</pre></b>
		</p>
	<h2><a name="History">History</a></h2>
        
	<p>Specifying RuleML with XML Schema (XSD) has allowed higher precision than DTDs, although
        it has proven to be non-trivial since the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/inxsd0.8.html#Issues">first attempt in 0.8</a>.
        After some issues were resolved, the transition from DTD to XSD was finally made in <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85">0.85</a>.
	The 0.85 release also included the <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.85/Inheritance_diagram.gif">modularization being inverted</a> to be more intuitive than the
	<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld012.htm">modularization used for 0.7 and 0.8</a>.  Other motivating factors behind this switch were
	simplicity (a single root with two distinct branches), consistency (inheritance in a single direction, for obvious super/subclass relationships)
	and efficiency (non-redundant implementation).</p>

      <p>This attempt to re-modularize the sublanguage hierarchy revealed an inconsistency in XML Schema with respect to using <code>&lt;redefine&gt;</code>:
      it is straight-forward to extend a particle's occurrence range by increasing the upperbound (i.e. the value of the <code>maxOccurs</code> attribute), but not when
      it comes to decreasing the lowerbound (i.e. the value of the <code>minOccurs</code> attribute). Particular to RuleML, this &quot;expressiveness gap&quot; in XML Schema does not
     permit extending a binary atom (e.g. in bindatalog) to have an unbounded number of terms (e.g. in datalog). After some
     <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2004May/0001.html">discussion</a> on the W3C XML Schema developers list
     (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/">xmlschema-dev@w3.org</a>), it was decided
     that the modularization introduced in RuleML 0.85 could not (properly) be implemented using XML Schema.</p>
		   		   
       <p>At this point the modularization was re-analyzed and various <a href="#Alternatives">alternatives</a> (discussed in detail later) were evaluated.  This lead to a
       whole new <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/modularization/model/archive/ruleml_m12n_uml.png">model of modularization</a>, which stayed basically the same for
       <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.86">0.86</a>, <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.87">0.87</a> and <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.88">0.88</a>,
        reflecting both the XML Schema implementation and the expressiveness layering of RuleML.  The model was
        <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/modularization/model/archive/ruleml_m12n_089_uml_05-06-09.png">significantly updated</a> for
        <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/0.89">RuleML 0.89</a>: new sublanguages were added while others were made unnecessary, related sublanguages were grouped 	together, and multiple levels of refinement for viewing the model were introduced.</p>
<h2><a name="Alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
        
        <p>As discussed in the <a href="#History">History</a> section, when technical problems with an earlier modularization of RuleML were discovered,
        three alternative versions were considered and implementated.  These alternatives and their evaluation are documented here for future
        reference.
        </p>
      <h3>Version 1: &quot;Bus&quot;</h3>
      <p>This first of the three alternative versions of RuleML modularization involves a novel
      approach, but <a href="bus/">its implementation</a>
      still involves a workaround which the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XML Schema Validator</a> (XSV)
       disagrees with in some cases.</p>
      <p>The basis of this approach is the separation of the actual schema driver from an &quot;auxiliary&quot;
      container module for each sublanguage.  The auxiliary modules inherit from one another while the
      drivers are not directly related, except through the auxiliary modules which they include.
      For example, the datalog sublanguage is specified in the driver
      <a href="bus/datalog.xsd">datalog.xsd</a>, which includes auxiliary module
      <a href="bus/aux_datalog.xsd">aux_datalog.xsd</a>.  Because of the XML Schema limitation,
      the <code>atom</code> module must be handled as a special case and be independent of the auxiliary
      modules, instead being included or redefined by each driver as needed.  In this way, the <code>atom</code> module
      does not have to begin as being binary, so no problems arise as a result of trying to
      decrease its lower bound.  The following diagram may clarify:</p>
<b><pre>     ...                          atom
      |                             |
aux_bindatalog -- [bindatalog] -----|
      |                             |
 aux_datalog ----- [datalog] -------|
      |                             |
aux_urdatalog --- [urdatalog] ------|
      |                             |
     ...                           ...</pre></b>
      <p>The similarity between this representation and a bus architecture diagram should be quite clear,
      hence the mnemonic of &quot;bus&quot; for this version.</p>
                
       <p>When attempting to validate hornlog.xsd, urhornlog.xsd, equalog.xsd or urequalog.xsd with XSV, the following message appears
       in addition to the usual results of successful validation:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white"><tr><td>
<b>Schema validator crashed</b><br>
The maintainers of XSV will be notified, you don't need to send mail about this unless you have extra information to provide.
If there are Schema errors reported below, try correcting them and re-running the validation.
</td></tr></table>
        <p>Other validators such as XMLSpy and Saxon respond much better, but this error nonetheless
           casts doubt on the validity of these schemas. Because there are better alternatives to this approach,
           however, we will not pursue the matter further.</p>

        <h3>Version 2: &quot;Star&quot;</h3>
            <p>This second approach is largely monolithic in the sense that the driver for each sublanguage is
               entirely independent of other sublanguage drivers (except for urdatalog, urhornlog, urequalog
               and negation sublanguages). Thus each driver includes (and/or redefines, as the case may be)
               from various modules, e.g. <a href="star/bindatalog.xsd">bindatalog.xsd</a>:</p>

   <b><pre>  ...
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/core_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/desc_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/clause_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/boole_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;modules/atom_module.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- restrict atoms to binary --&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom.extend&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;	
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;
  &lt;/xs:redefine&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/role_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;
	
  &lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;modules/term_module.xsd&quot;/&gt;	
  
  ...</pre></b>

<p>This might be visualized as follows, revealing the reason behind this approach being labeled &quot;star&quot;:</p>
<b><pre>
          atom    boole    term
             \      |       /
              \     |      /
       core -- [bindatalog] 
              /     |      \    
             /      |       \    
           role   clause   desc  
</pre></b>
      <p>The <a href="star/">implementation</a> of this version of modularization is quite straightforward
      and validates fine in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XSV</a>; the monolithic quality
      of the schemas avoids the aforementioned issue altogether. However, it
      deviates from previous versions of RuleML by involving very little inheritance, making sublanguage
      relationships (and expressivity) unclear.  Another downside is that there is a lot of redundancy among
      the sublanguage drivers with modules being included separately in each.</p>
      <p>This approach is basically the same as that used for the 
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml-modularization-20040218/">modularization of XHTML</a>,
      but it seems much better suited for such scenarios where only a few sublanguages are involved. It is
      far from ideal for RuleML.
      </p>

        <h3>Version 3: &quot;Tree&quot;</h3>
        <p>The final approach considered here is similar to a
           <a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld012.htm">previous modularization</a> though
           oriented slightly differently and now involving elementary modules. It might be visualized as follows,
           a tree centered around the datalog sublanguage:</p>
<b><pre>
                    core
                      |
                atom  | desc

</pre></b>
       <p>Clearly this version of modularization involves much more direct inheritance (indicated
          by &quot;*&quot;) than the other versions so far considered. Its <a href="tree/">implementation</a>
          avoids the XSD-technical limitation and is consistent with previous
          RuleML specifications wherein sublanguage relationships are
          explicitly indicated by taking advantage of inheritance.  For example, bindatalog
          is fundamentally the same as datalog except with binary atoms, so
          <a href="tree/bindatalog.xsd">bindatalog.xsd</a> need only slightly 
          redefine <a href="tree/datalog.xsd">datalog.xsd</a>:
       </p>

<b><pre>  ...

  &lt;!-- bindatalog redefines datalog so that atoms are binary --&gt;
  &lt;xs:redefine schemaLocation=&quot;datalog.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:group name=&quot;atom.extend&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:group&gt;		
  &lt;/xs:redefine&gt;
  
  ...</pre></b>
       <p>Thus, the XSDs implementing this approach not only capture sublanguage expressiveness,
          but manage to do it in a compact and efficient way.          
       </p>

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>The following table roughly summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each version
            of modularization (where 1 is best, 3 is worst):</p>
