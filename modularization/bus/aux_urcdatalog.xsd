	<!--
		'UR'-centered refers to an atom's first ind _requiring_ an href attribute 
		while the second ind may or may not have an href attribute
		
		This 'local' constraint was impossible to express by DTDs, but is possible with
		XML Schema.  For the time being, however, it has been ignored (because using the
		current methodology, all attributes are global) and therefore urcdatalog is equivalent
		to urcdatalog.
