			Auxiliary XML Schema for a 'UR'-Centered Binary Ground-Datalog-Fact RuleML sublanguage

	<!--
		This schema is at the top of the hierarchy, so it simply includes the base modules.
		
		The atom module is an exception: it is included separately by the main driver schema
		(in this case, urcbindatagroundfact.xsd) because once atoms are declared as binary,
		there is (apparently) no way to widen the lower bound of the occurrence range
		i.e. from minOccurs="2" to minOccurs="1".  (There is no such difficulty with DTDs or,
		apparently, with Relax NG.)  As a result of this restrictive expressivity,
		there is no way to redefine bindatalog to get datalog without such a workaround.
		
		We're hoping that XML Schema 1.1 will address this issue.
