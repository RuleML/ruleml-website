<h1>Planned Extensions for RuleML 0.85 and 0.9</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/">Harold Boley</a>, <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/bgrosof/">Benjamin Grosof</a>, <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~stabet/">Said Tabet</a>, <a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/">Gerd Wagner</a></h2>

<p>
This is a preliminary prioritized list of planned RuleML 0.8 extensions for
incorporation into RuleML 0.85 and 0.9,
where the boundary between 0.85 and 0.9 is still open (and mostly a pragmatic issue).
</p>
  <h2>Sections</h2><ul><li><a href="#Overview">Overview</a><li><a href="#Extensions">Extensions</a></ul><h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
This document serves to plan the extensions of the current RuleML 0.8
<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld012.htm">system of sublanguages</a>
by similarly modular 0.85 and 0.9 additions, without yet committing to either DTDs
or XML Schema (or RELAX NG). Instead, use cases, markup examples, and suggested RuleML
standard semantics will suffice for the time being.
We can then discuss and filter the proposed extensions, see how they
fit together, check their semantics, complexity/efficiency, and
usefulness/applicability -- besides their markup syntax. Once stable, their
DTD (successor) definition and/or XSLT transformation can follow.
</p>
<p>
For this we have started to collect candidate extensions as a prioritized
list maintained here in XML to facilitate insertions/deletions, splittings/mergings,
and reorderings; also, hierarchical groupings over the currently flat list should be attempted.
Please, send your update suggestions to the below Site Contact.
Corresponding extensions to the graphical
<a href="http://www.ruleml.org/ruleml-krdtd/sld012.htm">sublanguage hierarchy</a>
will also be done.
When looking at this graph remember that the below extensions are also meant to be combinable in the
modular manner of the 'join' operation in a lattice. For example,
<a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/bgrosof/">Benjamin Grosof</a>'s courteous extension of logic programs  
is the combination of negation-as-failure, defaults, priorities, merging, and updating
as well as limited classical negation (in the logic program sense).
</p>
<h2><a name="Extensions">Extensions</a></h2>

<p>
The decreasing top-level order is used here mainly for expressing decreasing RuleML 0.9 priority,
but also temporary  RuleML 0.8 to 0.9 sequencing, so simple extensions may be put earlier
just because they can be realized more quickly.
<ol>
  <li>Sublanguages with negations &quot;not&quot; ('as failure') and &quot;neg&quot; ('classical'),
used together or in separate sublanguages.
<ul>
  <li><i>Use Cases</i>:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/AORML/RuleExamples.html#DR-DefDerAttr">DefDerAttr</a>
      <li><a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/AORML/RuleExamples.html#DR-Default">DR-Default</a>
      <li><a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/bgrosof/paps/fipa-grosof-07-00-distrib.ps">BRML/DAML-RULES</a>
    </ol>
  
  <li><i>Suggested RuleML Standard Semantics</i>:
Partial logic under the
preferential semantics of minimal/stable models. See the following
references:
    <ol>
      <li>Partial Logics with Two Kinds of Negation as a Foundation for 
   Knowledge-Based Reasoning, G. Wagner, H. Herre and J. Jaspars, 
   in D.M. Gabbay and H. Wansing (Eds.), What is Negation ?, Kluwer 
   Academic Publishers, 1999.
   <a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/PartialLogics.pdf">PartialLogics</a>
     <li>G. Wagner: &quot;Foundations of Knowledge Systems with Applications to 
   Databases and Agents&quot;, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998.
   <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~wagnerg/ks.html">ks</a>
    </ol>
  
</ul>
  
  <li>Possibility to include references to public ontologies/taxonomies
(in RDFS, description logics, DAML+OIL, OWL, and/or object-oriented class hierarchies),
for (a) assigning types or sorts to RuleML variables and/or
(b) calling role-term-like or frame-logic-like concept descriptions with argument roles
instead of Herbrand-term-like positional atoms in the body, not in
the head, corresponding to Carin's principle in ALLNR
(description logic combined with Horn logic).
  
  <li>Query language (building on SQL for relational databases, XQuery for XML,
RQL for RDF, and DQL for DAML+OIL),
using a 'query' tag, which acts like a rule body
(without a head). Initial version done as a RuleML 0.8 extension.
<ul>
  <li><i>Use Cases</i>:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/">RDF-Query-Rules | Implementation Survey | RuleML</a>
    </ol>
  
</ul>
  
  <li>Global modules for importing and merging rules/rulesets via copies or URIs, and local modules for
assumptions in queries (cf. DQL query language for DAML+OIL) and in rule bodies.
  
  <li>Override-performing meta-facts (meta-rules?) over rule labels, and/or a
syntactic &quot;qualification&quot; construct that subsumes  priorities, uncertainties,
lineage, etc. (perhaps including Bayesian probability, fuzzy logic, or rough sets).
  
  <li>Justifications.
  
  <li>Reaction rule format that subsumes most other
relevant forms of &quot;situated logic programs&quot;, &quot;ECA rules&quot;, and &quot;production rules&quot;
as in OPS5 and Jess.
<ul>
  <li><i>Use Cases</i>:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/AORML/RuleExamples.html#RR-CarReservReq">RR-CarReservReq</a>
      <li>...
    </ol>
  
</ul>
  
  <li>Sublanguages of ground facts combined with non-ground or ground imps
(as non-ground facts using non-ground imps with empty/absent bodies).
  
  <li>User-defined functions specified as conditional
equations, i.e. transformation rules. They can be called in RuleML's nanos.
<ul>
  <li><i>Use Cases</i>:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.ruleml.org/lib/discount-variations.ruleml">Discount Variations</a>
    </ol>
  
</ul>
  
  <li>Built-in (arithmetic etc.) relations (e.g, less) and functions
(e.g, plus).
  
  <li>Examine protocols for the transport, packaging and registration of RuleML rulebases:
some sort of a RuleML repository may be defined and a specification developed. We may also
need to explore issues of the 'discovery' of, and reference to, public rulebases,
databases, etc. (in various languages).
  
  <li>Disjunction in the body and, possibly, head as well as 'and'/'or'
nestings in the body.
  
  <li>Semantic attributes for 'rulebase' and 'imp'/'fact' tags for holding
results of static analyses (termination, determinism, complexity,
stratification, etc.).
  
  <li>Optional grouping of rules into 'procedures' of relation or function
definitions, which provide a handle for procedure-specific semantic
attributes.
  
  <li>Optional explicit quantifier scopes for 'imp' variables and more
full first-order expressiveness using Lloyd-Topor transformations.
  
  <li>Allowing further &quot;logical&quot; languages in the
body and head of a rule (SQL, RDF, KIF, ...).
  
  <li>Support for constraint rules, e.g. those of <a href="http://www.ebxml.org">ebXML</a>.
  
  <li>RuleML requirements to provide support for reasoning over XML documents.
  
  <li>RuleML and Case Based Reasoning.
