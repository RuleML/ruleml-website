	<!--
		'UR'-centeredness refers to Atoms requiring an Ind with a required href attribute
		followed by an Ind with an optional href attribute.
		
		This 'local' required-vs-optional constraint was not possible with DTDs and appears
		not to be possible with XSDs, so urcdatalog is currently equivalent to urdatalog
		(and thus just redefines it without modification, which is equivalent to using xs:include)
