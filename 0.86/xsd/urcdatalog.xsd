	<!--
		'UR'-centeredness refers to atoms requiring an ind with a required href attribute
		followed by an ind with an optional href attribute.
		
		This 'local' required-vs-optional constraint was not possible with DTDs and has yet
		to be implemented in the XSDs, so urcdatalog is currently equivalent to urdatalog
		(and thus just redefines it without modification, which is equivalent to using xs:include)
