Please note:

These XSDs were updated 2005-12-15, after the initial release date.

The update includes the following things:

1) adds <degree> as an optional element to <Atom> and <Equal>

2) adds <oid> as an optional first element of the following tags:

Performative module:
<RuleML>
<Assert>
<Query>
<Protect>

Equality module:
<Equal>
<Nano>

Cterm module:
<Cterm>
<Plex>

(The change makes this revised version a superset of the original,
so there should not be any compatibility issues.)

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
