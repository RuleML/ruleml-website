<h1>RuleML and DERI Collaborate on Rules and Services Technologies Based on
Their Standardization Initiatives</h1>

<h2>Boston, USA, Fredericton, Canada, Galway, Ireland, Innsbruck, Austria, April 22, 2005</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ruleml.org/">RuleML</a>, the leading provider of standards for rules technologies on the Web
and in distributed platforms, and <a href="http://www.deri.org/">DERI</a> (Digital Enterprise Research
Institute), the leading European effort in Semantic Web Services that
spearheads the Web Services Modeling Ontology (WSMO) working group, today
announced the formation of a collaborative effort on integrating their
platforms to enhance support for rules and services technologies. This
collaboration explores the deployment and extension of the RuleML family of
languages to integrate with the WSMO platform, focusing on rules and
services interoperability on top of RuleML and WSML, WSMO's Language
component. Anticipated benefits of this integration include that WSMO will
take advantage of the modular flexibility and tools available in RuleML, and
RuleML will be able to support the WSMO services modeling requirements.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ruleml.org/">RuleML</a> is about rule interoperation between commercially important families
of rule systems (including Production Rules, Relational and XML Databases,
Event-Condition-Action Rules, Prolog, and others), as well as between
industry standards relevant to rules (such as in the Semantic Web, XML, Web
Services, Web Service Discovery, Web Service Composition, and Web Service
Choreography, Business Processes, Privacy, Security, as well as Software
Modeling and Interface Specifications).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsmo.org/">WSMO</a> describes various aspects of Semantic Web Services to decrease the need
for human intervention for making heterogeneous components interoperable. It
enables automatic Service discovery, composition, mediation and invocation.
WSMO seeks to create a standard featuring simplicity (a solution to the
integration problem that is as simple as possible), completeness (solves all
aspects of the integration problem), and executability (a set of execution
semantics exists as well as a reference implementation). It is being
developed together with industrial as well as academic partners, and in
alignment with various research projects.</p>
