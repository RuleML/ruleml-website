
    This query computes the fee for a person.
    It is delegated to the program chair who computes the fee according
    to the defined policies of RuleML-2007.
    The program chair in a sub-conversation also asks the sponsoring chair
    if any discounts apply for the requester (e.g. because he is a sponsor).
