<!-- Originally, a flat equational logic (without function nestings) was defined here. -->
<!-- Now, our nested equational logic requires an atom version, called 'atomv', -->
<!-- with embedded applications, generalizing the flat atoms defined earlier; -->
<!-- analogously, a nano version with embedded applications is called 'nanov'. -->
<!-- We hence need two kinds of equational formulas, 'eq' and 'eqv', as well as -->
<!-- two kinds of conjunctions, 'and' and 'andv'. You can still do flatting, -->
<!-- which may now use 'eq' or 'eqv' variables. The 'v' always stands for 'by value' -->


<![%equalog.module;[

<!-- an expression is usable within equational formulas -->
<!-- expr uses ind, var, or cterm terms or nano formulas -->

<!-- an 'and' is usable within a body -->
<!-- and uses zero or more atomic or equational formulas -->

<!ELEMENT and ((atom | eq)*)>


<!-- an 'andv' is usable within a body -->
<!-- and uses zero or more atomic formulas or atomic 'by-value' formulas, -->
<!-- or equational formulas or equational 'by-value' formulas -->

<!ELEMENT andv ((atom | atomv | eq | eqv)*)>



<!-- an 'eq' is usable within a head, a body, and an 'and' -->
<!-- and uses two exprs -->
